His expectations are clear and he is dedicated to making sure his students understand the subject. He is definitely the Ryan Reynolds of the Classics department.", "Dr.Pope is an amazing prof, his lectures are clear, knows how to use powerpoint, and if you attend his classes and study for tests, you will get an A. And he is very helpful, always willing to talk to students.", "Awesome Professor. Taught very well. He's VERY enthusiastic about archaeology, and ancient Greece and Rome. He's super funny and cute and he totally looks like Superman. Like come on, admit it he does. Tests are easy as long as you study and go to class. Thank you Dr Pope, you are an excellent prof!!", "I agree, very knowledgeable and helpful, but its his job to be! At times the class was boring and lame, but he makes up for it by being easy on the eyes! He could teach his colleagues a thing or two about powerpoint. Tests are pretty fair if you go to class, slides for exam were wild card. Take this class only to fill your timetable.", "Took this course with him in first year, loved it and loved him. Such a nice guy and genuinely cares about his students and whether they understand his material.  Works really hard to make his lectures very clear and his webct pages are excellent.", "God I love this man, his class is the only one worth going to most days.  He's so fair and helpful, he should teach the rest of the department how to lecture and use powerpoint.  Good looking too.:)", "Dr. Pope is a walking encyclopaedia of information and knowledge. He works incredibly hard and is a fantastic lecturer. He goes out of his way to help students with paper ideas and bibliogrpahy, and he is a lovely person. I wish he taught more classes because he is so enjoyable.", "I hope the lectures get better because right now I am bored.  We are going so slow. But this seems to be his nature.  Good think he is easy on the eyes.  And for the record, he is married.", "Very engaging prof, keeps class super interesting, excellent dresser, odd sense of humour, wonder if he's married&#63;!!!  I think I'm in love........", "Dr Pope is AWESOME!!! Loved the class and him!!! His tests/exams are extremely fair and if you go to class and pay attention you will do well...He's a great prof and KNOWS his stuff!!!", "yeah hes hot but you have to wait it out until hes more comfortable to be rewarded by the class. and it IS very rewarding, once he becomes comfortable. He is also the nicest and most polite ever.", "He really knows what he is talking about, is very clear on what is to be expected for the tests and exams - it nothing should come as a suprise. Funny and helpful. He is incredibly hot, and sounds exactly like Derrick Zoolander.", "Dr Pope is amazing! He knows what he is talking about, is clear, bases his exams and tests directly on the lectures, and is really helpful after class as well. You need to go to his classes to do well, but if you do, it's not hard to get an A. Plus, he's amazingly hot, in a Ross Gellar kind of way. I hope I get to have him as a prof in the future!", "Love this prof, at first I thought he was terrible, but as the term wore on he grew on me. Knows his stuff plus makes class go by pretty quick.", "Dr. Pope is AMAZING ignore the previous post.  They obviously never went to class.  The man is incredibly nice and always willing to help.  Extremely fair both with marks and anything else.  Sure in the beginning he was quiet, but by the end of the year he was on fire!  :)", "Wow, this guy is a shrew. He hid behind his booth and I could barely understand him. Very nerdy and seems full of himself with his knowledge. Did not enjoy this class at all and turned me off of history all together", "Dr. Pope is AMAZING. A fair marker when the standards are high. He improved since last term. I enjoyed his style if you go to class it is easy to do well, and the essay assignments were interesting. It helps that he is easy on the eyes! ;O) I am soo glad he is staying. One of the best profs in the Classics Department!", "I just would like to Thank Dr.Spencer, he is really good and explian the material very well. I hope you teach us every year. THANK YOU.", "Dr. Pope is exactly like Ross Geller! He seems a little awkward, but if you listen he's really funny and interesting :) His lectures are well organized and his tests are straight from lectures. If you take good notes, it's easy to get a good mark.", "Very intelligent man, and good looking. Needs to relax a little, otherwise very informative and enthusiastic!", "a good guy, get a few beers into him and he'll come outta his shell soon enuf!", "No Comments", "Tall, moderately handsome BUT unclear, vague, pitchy, not helpful, does not give feedback, one can only hope that he'll loosen up and be actually competant in Greek Sanctuaries.", "Dr. Pope was very helpful and accomodating to his students.  He explained things in a clear and concise manner which made the subject matter easier to understand.", "No Comments", "LOOOOVES HIM", "Dr. Pope is fantastic! you have to pay attention in that class, or else you will be lost.  For God sakes people this IS university, you actually have to go to class and do some work!!!!  I hope he stays on, it will be nice to have some consistency in the department.  Ross Gellar all the way!", "Two word: Ross Geller.", "Dr. Pope is an awesome prof and you can tell that he really loves the stuff he is talking about.

Exam questions are taken right from class notes and assignments.", "He refuses to post his notes then makes his notes so long that you can't truly pay attention in class because you're too busy copying. You'll leave class with no idea what you covered - you're better off reading the textbook from home. He's a good guy but he needs to radically rethink how he teaches the course.

Definetly recommened going to class [although you dont really need to] - but i would go since she really makes the topics interesting. take this class if u are a visual learner and are good with basic math. tests are multiple choice, an easy doublt digit, but have to put in some extra effort to get that 12.", "Good teacher", "I found her dull, but a 'good' professor.

RIP Dr. Mead.", "Rest In Peace, Dr. Mead", "Loved him. May his soul R.I.P forever. Miss him at the University. His teaching was remarkable beyond what you would normally expect from a professor.", "I heard the school is planning to make a new statistics building on campus to honour DR. Mead, and it will be called Mead Hall. In lieu of flowers, students gave crib sheets and formula sheets with statistics formulas and proofs, written beautifully at his funeral, that took place at the funeral home near signature spa on barton street. We miss him", "The city of Hamilton is going to name a street near McMaster in memory of the Late Great Ernest Mead. It's going to be called Mead Street and there will be a giant picture of his head hanging from all the stop lights.", "There is a saying &quot;Only the good die young&quot;, Dr Mead proved it's true. A person like him deserved to live atleast 100 years. Everybody is missing him now. Even though he is not with us physically, he is there in our thoughts. We cherish the great moments he taught us actuarial math, and celebrate his life. His teaching skills were second to none.", "Who says Dr. Mead is no longer with us. He is very much alive and still with us. He lives in our hearts and is alive in our memories. Everyone, even now, has wet eyes when Remembering Dr. Ernest Roy Mead. We still remember him with the highest regards and affection. He was a true gentle man and his glass was almost always half full. R.I.P", "I hope the Good Lord takes care of him.", "He touched many lives when he was on this earth.", "He was great as a professor. God bless him.", "God bless him. May his soul rest in peace. The angels up in the sky are lucky to have such a great and genuine professor teach statistics to them!! Please dont torture the angels with your proof questions like you did to us. All your students in planet earth miss you.", "I really miss this professor. He was so kind to us. Although he did not provide a formula sheet and included lots of proof questions, he was still such a nice person. I was very shocked when I heard he is no more. May the Lord be with him. Dr. Mead you were the best actuarial professor that ever taught at Mcmaster!!!", "I feel very sorry for this professor. Everybody hated him, but he was such an old man. Now he's left us forever. May his soul rest in peace. He's in a better place now. R.I.P Dr. mead, gone but you will be alive in our hearts.", "I took his course in the summer and he was unbelievably mean. He wanted us to learn the formulas of the entire course!!! No professor ever does that. God bless him. When people would ask for information about exam, his standard reply was: This information has not been given out. All topics covered in class are eligible. People had nightmares.", "Bye bye. We'll miss you.", "So sorry to hear you're gone. Boo hoo!", "God bless his soul. may his soul rest in peace. One of the best professors I've ever seen at McMaster University. He is dearly missed by everyone. The whole University mourned for him.", "Just passing by this site. Is it really true&#63; Is he really gone&#63; Oh, what a shame. He was the best prof at Mac. Great lectures, clear voice, understandable material, oh yeah, he was that great. Even though he passed away, his legacy will live on forever.", "RIP old man. You are very missed!", "He turned me away from Stats forever. I decided never to take any more stats after experiencing the nightmare of his class. He provided no formulas for the summer stats 2D03 section and gave such an super long exam. This prof was totally out of touch with reality. Everyone hated him with a huge passion but he was shameless enough to teach still.", "I had Dr. Mead as a prof around 4 or 5 years ago. He gave me a TWO in the course (Grade of D) and I had worked very hard. Today I'm doing a PH.D in Statistics from a different University. It shows how unreasonable and unfair this prof is. He does not reward students' hard work and genuinely enjoys failing his students. He wont give out any clues!!", "He likes to fail his students. I studied very hard and I am a straight A student, however I got only D-in his class.", "His final exam was a nightmare", "If u take a course with prof.ernest roy mead u will get F grade 100% guarantee. He told us in class that he enjoys giving F grade!! Can you believe it&#63; He asked us once what is your favourite alphabet, he said his fav alphabet is F with a sarcastic smile :(", "He is an incredibly mean person along with being a bad prof with poor teaching ability. He does not give a formula sheet with his exams and expects students to memorize 100's of them", "He is a very bad prof and he likes and enjoys to fail his students.", "Terrible prof.", "HIS FINAL EXAM FOR STATS 2D3 SUMMER WAS THE HARDEST THING IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. UNBELIEVABLE PROF.", "Poor quality teaching + Unreasonable demands on students (i.e. No formula sheet provided, LOTS of Proofs and Derivations on exams) + EXTREMELY Boring Lectures + Interest Ruined from the material for ever = A course with Dr Mead", "Terrible prof!!! HE wont give a formula sheet with our final exam and there are million formulas to remember.

Bad lecturer and writes difficult tests.", "HORRIBLE PROFESSOR. HE LIKES ASKING QUESTIONS SUCH AS &quot;PROVE...&quot;, &quot;DERIVE...&quot; ON HIS TESTS AND EXAMS. HE IS MONOTONE AND BORING TO LISTEN TO AND HAS NO INTERACTION WITH THE CLASS WHILE LECTURING", "Professor is INHUMANE. He has no symapthy. He asks so many proof questions for a summer Stats 2D03 class and his tests are WAY TOO long for 50 minutes. Ridiculous prof! And SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BORING!!!!!!!", "He mumbles when he is teaching. I am not impressed. I want a refund. I had better expectations when I took this course.", "He likes to ruin the career of his students that is why he is so boring and so tough. He is so boring that once you take a course with him, you will never want to see the textbook of that course ever again. I feel sorry for he students who listen to him 3 hours at a time during the summer. Boring teaching combined with hatred for students= VERY BAD", "OMG HIS FIRST TEST WAS SO HARD!!", "He was terrible!!! So many people failed his course or dropped it.", "Bad Experience with him! :(", "A terrible SHAMELESS man who continues to teach despite the fact he knows that students hate him so much. If I was a professor and I knew students disliked me, I would either change my teaching style or just resign if I can't improve myself. He should do us a favour and just go away. Please retire. That will be the happiest day of our lives!!!!", "He is the toughest stats prof in the entire history of this institution. I was happy that he is going to retire but unfortunately he is back to teach stats 2d03 this summer!! aww..poor kids..I feel sorry for anyone who has to take Mead's class. Take it and you will regret it. You have been warned.", "He was terrible when I had taken his course many years ago!! He offers no help to his students.", "It is mcmaster's loss because of Dr. mead's untimely passing. He will be sadly missed by faculty, staff, undergraduate and graduate students alike. He was a genuine human being that really cared for everyone and was unfailing to polite to students. He would do whatever he could to help a student succeed. He gave out so much information for exams!!", "R.I.P Dr. Mead, he was a very good man. His sense of humour, his unparalleled enthusiasm in the classroom, his willingness to go &quot;extra distance&quot; and bend over backwards to help students at any time of the year and in all situations, will be missed by all. He was a great teacher. Very knowledgeable in the field of statistics, a leader in his field", "This course was a waste of money time and energy. A course like this was not worth a cent \r let alone the $600 I paid, and this instructor truly is not fit to teach. He spent the entire time doing proofs in class, that I bet he has no clue what any of that garbage means, on the final exam, he asked 5 calculations and only 1 proof. Waste of time!!!!", "Worst prof ever. No teaching skills. He only has mumbling skills. Speaks in his mouth. hard to hear or understand. Everyone strongly dislikes this instructor because he doesn't want to help students even. He is so rude when you email him &quot;Everything covered in class is eligible&quot; is his standard answer when you ask for information about tests", "I dont know where to start even. I am not the type of person who would write bad comments about a prof online, that too such an old man, but he has no sympathy for his students. He doesnot like to give even 0.001% hints about the format of his final exams or what is expected. He takes revenge from students because very few people attend his lecture", "MEAD IS SO STUBBORN HE DOESNT LISTEN TO ANYBODY OR CARE ABOUT ANYONE. USE THE ****ING MICROPHONE MAN AND STOP MUMBLING. NOBODY CAN HEAR HIM. HE NEVER SMILES EVEN. WHY IS HE TEACHING US. WE DESERVE A BETTER PROF FOR THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE PAY TO MAC. ITS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF THE TERM AND HE IS DRIVING ME NUTS ALREADY. MOST GARBAGE PROF SEEN", "He is very mean to students", "Everyone hates this instructor, and he already knows it that students hate him. He consistently gets poor evaluations from students. If he has any shame or self-respect whatsoever, he should just quit teaching and leave us alone. He probably lives a horrible life and tries to make his students lives terrible too. What a sad excuse of a professor!", "Does not give a clear answer when students email him. He likes to make his students sad, both in class, and in terms of marks. His lectures cause sadness, and the grades he assigns will make you cry. He is certainly the worst professor not only in the math department but also in the entire McMaster University. Worst prof in the entire world!!!", "My deepest condolences, and deepest sympathy for all engineering students who will enrol in STATS 3Y03 in the coming term with this horrendous prof. This man has no heart, and no human feelings. He will make every course he teaches way harder than it has to be. He won't provide any formula sheets with the exam making life miserable for students.", "He is the most unfair prof in the history of math department. If you ask him for any help regarding exam studying he will say 'all topics covered in class are eligible', he hates helping students. He is not fit to be in the teaching profession.", "incredibly low quality prof. hates students. seems bitter and angry at the world. gets a sadistic pleasure out of making other's lives miserable.", "I had dr.mead last year for Actuarial Math II and oh boy, was he awful. He has no mercy on his students. Chances of failing his courses are pretty high. His final exams are much tougher than his tests, so donot bother enrolling in any of his courses. Emotional scarring caused by his courses may fade away but the big fat F he gives won't go away.", "pretty horrible i must say..... ur better off just reading the book", "This guy will kill your interest in math. YOU WILL HATE MATH. IT WILL BECOME YOUR NIGHTMARE if you take any course with mead. He does not provide any formula sheets on exams and he enjoys failing his students. All other criticisms about him are true and valid. Look on his internal class evaluations on MUGSI &quot;Instructor declined to give permission&quot;", "He is the nastiest prof in the mathematics and statistics department. Rude, unfair, senile, monotone, interest ruiner, doesn't give a **** about his students. If you want a big fat F on your transcript, do enroll in his courses. Rumour has it that he is retiring from McMaster this year. Good riddance! He is way too old to teach anyways.", "Absolute WORST professor I have ever had in my 3 years at this school. He is extremely boring and unenthusiastic in lecture. STATS 3S03 would be a very easy course if he followed the text but instead he spends 99% of the time in class on proofs, making the course far more difficult than it should be. Getting any help from him is an impossible task!", "If I could give less than 1 out of 5 to this professor I would do it. He is so bad he will make you hate math and ruin any interest you have in studying mathematics. On top of that this he is hard as nails. He asks proof questions on financial math tests which is supposed to be a water down math course, for business type of students. He's so mean.", "An overall terrible prof. Monotone voice and listening to him 830 in the morning is impossible and a complete waste of time. Going to his lectures will actually lower your IQ and make you frustrated. If you are insomniac, Mead's class will cure you. He's soo mean he doesn't provide any sample tests and absolutely no hints for the tests. Awful!!!!!", "MEAD is the worst-EST-EST professor in math. His tests are extremely hard, he likes giving 'PROOF' questions, going to his lecture will cause you major depression. He is very unhelpful when you email him. Really doesn't like helping students and if you ask him something, he would reply something else, usually some non-sense. Horrendous experience.", "worst damn prof ever. seriously. DONOT DONOT DONOT take his courses. He is so boaring and monotone, he comes in and talks to the board, NEVER makes eye contact with the class, no class interaction. Stats 3S03 is supposed to be really easy, but all he does is PROOFS on the blackboard, and includes proofs on tests. Horible experience. Avoid this guy", "zzzzzzzz....I slept through all his lectures, he must have been telling bed-time stories.  Seriously, very dull professor.  He puts up overheads and we are always furiously copying while he talks in a monotone.", "Ernest Roy Mead is very tough professor.", "Dude's a mead-head.", "He is really bad", "Extremely hard course and the prof didn't make it any easier.  Most boring teacher I have ever had.  And the T.A. didn't even speak English.  Can't hear the prof most of the time either.", "This class was probability theory and I found Mead's mean (average) lecture to be &quot;painfully boring&quot; with a standard deviation ranging between &quot;suicide inducing&quot; and &quot;tranquilizing&quot;.  Only thing more boring than him was the textbook.  The probability of you enjoying this course is close to 0.", "Good prof", "The course was pretty brutal... we should have had a formula sheet... concepts weren't hard but deriving formulas (or recalling from memory) and applying them in time to complete the tests was difficult...", "Avoid going to his classes (straight outta textbook)... worst teach I've had at MAC.... went up to him for help once and he did JACK SH*T... NOT HELPFUL, stick to research buddy", "Mead is one of the most dull teachers you can get. This class is a good one to take a nap in. He's a straight text book teacher and he mumbles like crazy. He's too old to teach!", "I never cancelled a course until i came across Dr.Mead. His tests are a little unpredictable and we didn't have a TA, which i think we needed. I think he should retire and give himself and the students a break.", "The course is hard and his notes are useless as they have nothing to do for what is on the tests.

Great class if you like to learn!", "Supposed to be a university statistics course. However, we spent an entire week learning about mean, median and mode.

"comments": ["Very interesting lectures and tells a lot of interesting stories. Great prof! The textbook readings are really boring and the test questions are very specific about the readings.", "Dr. Day is fantastic. You'd be hard pressed to find a student of his that active dislikes him and his courses. The content is interesting, the tests are fair, and he has many interesting stories to tell.", "Dr. Day's lectures are great - clear, organized, and interesting. His tests were typically fair, except the 10% of questions which were based on textbook readings (incredibly specific; you'd have to study the textbook for hours to know the answers, and for only 10% it didn't make sense to even bother with the textbook). But great prof overall.", "Dr. Day is a genius. Best prof at mac. He is nice but he will test you and you will learn.", "He's a great prof. He is very engaging, and always giving students an opportunity to ask questions. His tests can be tricky but if you study and go to his lectures/watch the podcasts, you'll do really well. There's always his quiz bank as well!! He tells some pretty great stories too", "By far my favourite prof EVER. His lectures were so engaging and interesting to listen to! He really does everything in his power to help you succeed! Some of his test questions can be a little tricky, but that's expected with every psych course. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND", "Dr. Day is an absolute gem.  Amazing lectures - I've not once fallen asleep in his class. His tests are not difficult if you use the resources he gives you, which is a lot of stuff (podcasts, test bank, handbook). He is so sweet and approachable, kinda wish he was my grandpa. He knows his stuff and is up to date on a lot of pop culture.", "It's great to hear him talk. I read about him going off on tangents and I did not find this true at all. Everything is relevant. Tests are so hard, testing on incredibly tiny details and stats. Prepare to memorize. Very good for providing content - there's quiz bank, podcasts, course handbook (which is basically all lecture material written out).", "Lectures were decently interesting. Exams were unnecessarily tricky and hard.", "Also took 2AP3 with him. This course has less stats and numbers but still both very content, research, and studies heavy. Know the deets! Overall, would take again though. Podcasted, and he's just SO AMAZING AND INSPIRATIONAL to listen to. Thank you Dr. Day for being an INCREDIBLE teacher and ENGAGING lecturer. Would take again!! 3", "WOW! Seriously ONE OF MY FAVE PROFS AT MAC - FOR SURE. Ties with Ostovich for my fave psych prof at Mac, but he's a lot funnier, caring, and wise. Such a cool dude if you ever get to strike up a conversation with him. Extremely lecture heavy, but no group projects haha! Just the midterms and final. The test bank will be your best friend! Numbers!", "Just get ready to over-use a test bank for days before your midterm.  His tests are very fair, considering he gives a test bank.  His text book questions are difficult, but that's the only downside. He is a gem.", "Dr. Day teaches so well on this course, but the tests materials are on details some of them. You really need to know the stuff well and understand them not just memorize them especially for the data he provides on lecture, it is testable in tests. But I take a lot of psychology courses with him, because he makes the psychology interesting", "Dr. Day is an awesome prof. He knows a lot about psychology. I take his course every year because he teaches lots of psychology courses at MAC. If you want to do well on his test, you really need to do more exercises which he provides them on his website and they are really helpful. Also, you need to read the textbook before you go to the exam.", "This guy is a great prof. He's funny, kind, welcoming to students. His tests are brutally hard & there is no way I would be able to pass them without the lecture recordings. He asks VERY specific questions, so you pretty much need to know ALL the details about everything. The MC questions are very tricky and at times hard to understand", "Great prof, hard tests. The lectures were very interesting. Tests were all m/c and I found them to be very challenging (coming from a student who got As in almost every other course). Be ready to read a lot of textbook.", "Dr. Day is one of the best lecturers at Mac and also my personal favourite prof. I took both 2AP3 (abnormal psych) and 2B03 (personality). I wouldn't say these were easy courses because you do need to work hard, however, they were extremely interesting courses. He posts podcasts and also gives quiz banks in preparation for the midterms.", "I have taken all of his classes, and he is an amazing prof. Yes, his tests are tricky, but if you study well and hard, you will do fine. I ended up with a 10 in his positive psych class. Highly recommend taking his classes!!!", "The content is so interesting - I really did learn a lot!! He podcasts every lecture!! He is a really clear and interesting lecturer too. However, my criticism for this course is the textbook content that appears on tests (SO RANDOM) - that's the only place I'd lose marks on tests. I don't understand what he looks for in the text. Otherwise great.", "I think he's pretty vague with what he expects you to know.", "Dr. Day is THE best prof at Mac. He has great stories to aid his lectures and he's super helpful. Love him and he's such a cutie!", "I love Dr.  Day. He is such a wonderful speaker and is so knowledgeable on the subject that I'd love to take his other classes. The tests were tough and stat-heavy but still worth it, because the lectures (in my opinion) were great and always interesting. Never once fell asleep in that class, and that's saying something.", "Dr. Day is one of the best profs at McMaster. He's got a natural talent to be very engaging and organizes his courses really well. I would highly recommend taking a course with him!! (I took 4!)", "he was very good", "classes are podcasted but content is interesting so unless it is at 8:30, you should go to class. Quiz bank was helpful but you still need to know a lot of information. Textbook readings are tedious. I liked when he brought in speakers on mental illness in abnormal psych. Dr. Day is very on top of things and gets marks out quickly. Very up to date", "Dr. Day was fantastic as a lecturer! However his tests killed me and I wasn't ready for the ridiculous amount of detail that would be asked. I literally failed his second midterm even though I went to every class and read the textbook.  Otherwise.. awesome prof. ", "Great prof, it's clear he knows his stuff. The quiz bank is very helpful, but you really have to know your stuff to do well in his course. ", "Fantastic prof; I'm taking every one of his courses I have the pre-requisites for because of this class!", "Excellent lecturer, but the tests are VERY difficult. Asks for details that are often insignificant.", "Best prof ever", "This class was actually really hard :( I read the textbooks and attended every class but his midterm questions were very specific in regards to textbook that it was hard for me to fully recall all the details that I've read. He's a good professor whose passionate with what he does but this is definitely not a GPA booster.", "He's a great prof that knows his material. The only problem is that the test bank questions glitch A LOT, especially the day before the exam. At least 40% of the test bank questions were wrong and varied each time. He has to fix that, there is no point in having a test bank if there's a chance what you're learning is wrong.", "Great lecturer, best prof at McMaster", "The multiple choice tests are hard! And half the time filled with errors and grammatical issues which lead you to have a difficulty understanding what is asked of you. If you are not focused on the exam, you won't do well unless you know exactly what he is asking. It is a hard course I suggest if you are taking this as an elective, don't.", "Finished personality with him and taking positive psychology right now. Very helpful in answering questions and clarifying details.  His tests are pretty tough because the answers seem pretty similar to each other in that most of them seem right. His textbook questions are also pretty specific and I ended up guessing most of them.", "Very Very Very hard. If you do not go through the material with very fine detail, you will fail. His tests are very difficult, and you must study!!", "I took 3 psych courses with him and got A+ in all. He is very good at explaining concepts but his tests are challenging because they are unbelievably ambiguous. You have to choose one correct answer but at least 2 answers look correct. I didn't like him as a prof but his lectures are very useful even in future.", "This guy loves to hear his own voice.", "My favourite professor at Mac. His podcasts are extremely helpful when you can't get to class. Brings interesting guest lecturers. Yes, his tests are difficult but he has a huge database of sample questions which you should do consistently. The sample questions are super helpful and will easily help boost your test marks. ", "I loved the lectures, he used great examples to illustrate his concepts- but tests were super hard. He provides practice tests, but they don't help unless you really know your stuff. I'd recommend creating a fake test with all the concepts prior to a test, that way your brain will better recognize the way the questions are posed on the test.", "I hated that class. Not for the info but because the marking. Ruined it for me", "Terrible Prof! He claims he makes his tests hard to make you learn better, but after his harsh marking I never want to take psych again!", "If I could warn past me, I would never take it again", "I usually excel. I have a very good work ethic, and I even have a good basis of psych. Yet I struggled so hard with his tests. I understood everything in the course though. I even applied it to my everyday life but when it came to tests I felt it was difficult and the answers depended a lot on a single word or practise questions. ", "He is such an amazing prof to listen to, his lectures are so interesting and he's very well spoken. But if you're looking to get a good grade, you're going to have to work you never have before. Extremely difficult exams. He's really big on statistics... ", "He is a very nice and understanding prof, podcasts every lecture and his exams are fair", "By far the best professor at Mac. His lectures are never boring and he records all of them and posts them online. His exams are a bit tricky, but he provides the class with practice questions and most of them show up on the exams. I've taken all of his classes because they are so interesting and he's such a good prof.", "A very kind, helpful and informative prof. His lectures are definitely worth attending. Tests are very difficult.", "VERY DIFFICULT QUESTIONS. Mid terms are very hard and it is difficult to get anything above a C-. Prof needs to ease up on the difficulty with the questions", "Best prof ever. Interesting course with lots of laughs. Very clear way of teaching. Study hard though and use the question bank for studying or you will not do so well on the exams as they can be tricky.", "Everyone loves him because they've never been told to think critically about the DSM by a prof before, let alone on who designs his lectures with laughs embedded in. He is an ivory tower psychology professor teaching a distant and offensive look at psychological problems. He has his strengths, but he refuses feedback on his offensive Freudian crap.", "Great lecturer, incorporates hilarious personal examples into material. The question bank is key.", "I've taken 3 courses with him so far and loved every single one of them! He is the ideal professor. :)", "I've taken every one of Dr. Day's classes because honestly he is the best professor by far at McMaster. He records all his lectures keeping in mind some student just can't get to class everyday and it allows you to make the best notes. He provides practice questions as well. Awesome prof, if you study you'll definitely get a B or higher.", "Dr. Day is an amazing prof!! Makes class so interesting! Loved going to class; even asked to do research with him but he does not do any. Loved his classes!!!!", "Great professor. I really like that he was able to post all his lecture online. Extremely helpful!!! Exams are not that easy. Multiple choice is confusing and the class average wasn't that great. Class was a lot of fun and I would take another class with Dr Day, anyway!", "Extremely difficult exams. Tricky multiple choice. Studied for hours understood the material but the questions were just too complex. Interesting material presented really well, love the online and recorded options, makes it easy for a mature student. Would take his class again BUT PLEASE ease up on the difficult, way too hard!!!!!!Seriously", "Amazing Professor! His passion about the subjects he taught made me excited about the material that we were learning. Such an amazing guy as well :)", "intelligent, passionate, and an excellent speaker. This man deserves the world.", "Amazing prof. Very interesting to listen to. Cares about his students a lot.", "One of the best profs I've had at Mac so far! His pod casts are helpful if you've missed class. Make sure to read the textbook because he tests you on random stuff in the text. Answer the quiz bank he provides the class, majority of the questions (or similar ones) on the exam/midterm is on there. Overall, enjoyable class! :)", "Amazing professor!", "Awesome prof. Very knowledgeable!", "He is a brilliant professor with a flawless teaching style. His supplementary quiz questions, podcasts, lecture slides, and lecture handbook ensures we have the material necessary and more to succeed. He is passionate, engaging and wise, and is by far the best professor I have ever had.", "the best prof at Mac. His lecture was interesting and helpful.", "He is a very good prof,he made the content interesting and clear.", "Amazing professor. Crystal clear and very interested in the content.", "The greatest professor I have ever come across. He speaks so clearly and makes everything that he is teaching interesting and valuable to you. He is extremely helpful if you have any questions and is seriously rooting for you to get a good mark in his course. If you study the lecture content, the practice quizzes and the textbook you can do great.", "He is by far one of the best professors I have come across at Mac. I was really discouraged to take another Psych course after first year, since Psych 1X03/1XX3 is a hot mess, but I am so glad I took his course. Make detailed lecture notes, read the text, (do the quizzes!!) and you're gold.", "had him for 2BO3. honestly, so far the best prof i have ever had at mac. so helpful and approachable. always making sure students understand and get good grades! amazing!", "Dr. Day is one of my favourite professors at Mac. He is a great lecturer, his tests are fair and relatively easy to do well in. Make sure to do lots of questions from his question bank online as he reuses a lot of them on the tests.", "Dr. Day is a great man. He has been teaching this course for over 20 years at Mac. He is tenured and is a National M3 teaching fellow highly regarding amongst his peers. He is very passionate about what he teaches. He is technical. Read the required textbook readings and make notes (they aren't long). Hard exams. Practice Q's!!!", "Amazing professor, his lectures are concise, straight to the point and very interesting. Best prof I had in the psychology department for sure. His tests are fair and easy to do well in!", "Amazing prof. Explains with so much clarity, his tests are a little hard but you can do great if you study. His practice quizzes are very helpful!", "Amazing prof! Even though he posted his lectures online he was so amazing I went to class anyway. Such a good speaker", "I loved this course. I took 2AP3 in the fall, and was delighted to have Dr. Day again for personality. Even though he offers recordings, I still found myself attending every 8:30am class of his. Very fun prof, I plan to take another one of his courses in the future.", "My favourite professor ever. I always experience &quot;flow&quot; when he teaches (Positive psych students know what I'm talking about!)", "Had Dr.Day for 5 courses now, hands down best prof i have had at Mac. His lectures are enjoyable, if there was one prof i ever connected with it was him. All MC tests that can be tricky but he doesn't trick you with course material he is very helpful giving you all the information possible", "Great prof!", "Best prof at mac so far. Hilarious, interesting and knows what he's talking about,", "Really good prof in that he thoroughly makes use of every resource (lecture, courseware, textbook, online notes, recordings, website). Particularly liked how he handled 2AP3 by dispelling stereotypes about people w/ mental disorders.", "Amazing prof! One of the best I've encountered at McMaster so far! Extremely helpful and approachable, and explains everything in detail.", "He's a great professor - really enthusiastic! However, a lot of questions are drawn from the extremely long textbook. A bonus: he records his lectures and always posts the powerpoints online!", "Best prof EVER!! I love psych, and to be honest I'm not 100% sure if I love it due to content or because of him!! His classes are not easy but he gets you so interested it makes you want to study and do well!", "I LOVE HIM!!He's a wonderful prof! Makes going to class enjoyable and you will ace this class!", "I have taken almost all his classes. - personality, attitudes and believes, abnormal, forensic, positive psych (no longer offered), and he is hands down my favorite prof at MAC. He is a great teacher! The material interesting and the tests aren't too difficult if you have gone to class and read the text book. Awesome prof!", "Good prof, sometimes difficult tests, but overall good prof.", "best prof ever!", "BEST PROF I'VE EVER, EVER, EVER HAD. I love him. And positive psychology was probably the most relevant course I've taken at McMaster. Kudos to Dr. Day for making psych so awesome akfjhlaksjfh", "I took 2B03 last term, and now 3BA3. Dr. Day is phenomenal. He is an amazing lecturer. Probably the best I have encountered in my 4 years. His tests are challenging, kind of tricky sometimes. I disliked not having practice questions for 3BA3 but it was understandable considering the course is quite new. Anyways, AMAZING prof! Take his course!!", "Best Prof I've ever had. Do his practice questions and you will kill the course!", "The best prof I have ever had, completely dedicated to teaching.  Unbelievably interesting, blends the nuts of bolts of the suject with relevant  examples from today. Psych wasn't my major, but I took every Dr Dick Day course I could take. Sometimes his MC tests got tricky considering the time. For example &quot;Which one of these is not unimportant &#63;&quot;", "Taken 3n03, 3cc3, 2b03, 1a03/1aa3 with him. Got an A+ in all. By FAR, best lecturer at Mac. Few would dispute this. Amazingly comfortable up there, very entertaining, and knowledgable. Only prof where I've actually taken a class for the prof. Tests are all MC... not everyone does well, but if you're smart, pretty easy as long as you study", "Great to listen to! Very clear and easy to understand. Tells great stories. Makes the class interesting. All you have to do is take good notes, do his practice tests over and over and you will get an A. That's what I did and aced his class :)", "He is one of the best profs I have ever had! He was extremely interesting and helpful. His tests were super hard but it still ended up being my favorite class. I am definitely looking forward to taking his personality class!", "Very dedicated. Does not actively research in order to focus on teaching which is a rarity in the academic world. One of the most active and engaging professors going.", "amazing professors clearly explains all the concepts and theories. makes sure that everyone understands what he he is talking about", "Amazing prof, by far the best i've had at mac. Uses his experiences to really make his point. Very knowledgable and passionate about what he does.", "AMAZING PROF!!!!", "Dr. Day is a great prof!! Going to his lectures is like listening to a story, not like work at all! He records all of his lectures so if you will never miss a class. Material is also very interesting. My favourite prof. I plan on taking all the courses he teaches :)", "LOVE HIM!", "Day is one of the best profs at mac. Even if you dont remember the materials, it is hard to forget his examples. I am in my 3rd and I still rememeber his examples from 1st yr! His tests are not hard if you study for them. But they are tricky -  Need to read b/w the lines. Overall he is he is simply amazing. I never met a person who d.n like Dr. Day", "Dr Day is a fixture at McMaster. He has been here forever and he seems like a celebrity. He is an absolutely amazing prof. He knows what you're going to ask before you even say the second word of a question. And when he does answer he is entirely knowledgeable and always has a life example to offer. Love him", "Wonderful professor. Started off as just another elective, and suddenly I formed a new found love for personality, and psychology in general. Extreme knowledgeable and creative individual, who truly has a passion for teaching.", "Dr. Day loves teaching and makes the subject matter enjoyable. You got to love his socks with sandels", "Richard Barlow Day is the toughest psychology professor at McMaster University. His Multiple choice exams are very very hard especially for upper year courses.", "Richard Barlow Day is the toughest psychology professor at McMaster University. His Multiple choice exams are very very hard especially for upper year courses.", "Dr. Day is amazing prof but his courses are not for the faint hearted. You really need to keep up with the readings and do your readings well ahead of time not night before the test otherwise you're screwed. If you studied hard you will find his tests challenging but fair. It's all multiple choice and well spread out, not just few questions.", "**** is an amazing psych professor.  very knowledgeable and helpful.  even though i haven't taken any courses with him since first year psych (on video), 3  years later, i still keep in touch with him.", "Amazing prof. His tests and exams are all MCQ. You have to know the material really well in order to get good marks, must have done the readings timely and not the day before. Great teaching style.", "Whatever you're paying this guy, it's not enough.", "As the Associate Dean of Science he was AWESOME!!", "He's so cute! I love his videos...he makes psych so interesting! I would totally recommend him to anyone", "I really enjoyed this course! Dr. Day taught us all the personality theories you can read in all the self-help books on the market right now. The textbook must be read in order to get an A+.", "Although the midterms were on the difficult side, the final was a breeze! Looking at previous midterms and doing the online questions REALLY help. As many have mentioned, the videos do get kind of dry, but he's a very good speaker and his lessons are clear and structured. If you use the resources he provides for you, you'll do MORE than well.", "This class rocked. The courseware is like a para-phrased textbook! This was the only course where I got a 95% on one of my exams! Dr.Day is a nutbar in a good way.", "i had the video lectures in 1a03 as well, and it hasn't gotten much different this semester. the videos allow you to not take as much notes, but then again you're not as interested in class, which is where it really matters. overall pretty good prof and friendly when you meet him in person. maybe i'll actually get the live version in next years.", "RAWKS", "Dr. Day is a great prof.The custom courseware is super useful and easy to understand,and the website was a big help with studying.I think he did an awesome job on the video lectures, and the transcripts meant that I could get an awesome mark without taking a single note in class!The only people I know who didn't like the course were total slackers.", "brutal - stupid video lectures don't keep your interest at all, very scienc-y course. intro psychs suck cause its such a broad overview, but the disconnect with the prof makes it worse. plus i got screwed on the group project both times - got stuck in a group that didnt care and ended up doing all the work just to pass! TA totally unhelpful!", "i never had him in 1a03 because i took it in the summer. i had him for 2b03 and he's hilarious! we had 2 tests, and the first one i got 65% (i studied so hard for it) and the second one i got 87% (i barely studied for this one)... but yeah, his multiple choice q's are pretty tricky. he's probably the best prof i've had so far.", "Dr. Day is nice in person when you meet him...there is no real problem with him but more the content in his courses. He is sometimes hard to follow in his lectures and texts and is really harsh on his exams...", "I'm sure Dr.Day would be a good professor if he wasn't lecturing through those videos.. those vidoes are horrible and put you to sleep. the coursewear is useless.. try a real textbook please.. if you didnt understand soemthign from the lectures you would hope the textbook would clear it up.. WRONG its a repeat of his lecture..and the TA's are usele", "I love the MC tests, and I thought the video lectures covered everything we needed to know. I like the way he's set up the course, and I found the custom courseware of much value. He's extremely nice, and super helpful!", "His test and exam were trickster and the video lectures were booooooooooooooooooooooring but he was a nice guy and I thought the material was interesting. He should update the videos lol.", "How about get rid of the movies&#63;", "Even the the video lectures are sometimes dry and an 8:30 timeslot is miserable, this is an excellent class and the prof does a good job explaining material.", "A tough prof (his tests are tough) but he is better than other profs teaching this class. His exams are all multiple choice, so you don't have to worry about doing assignments or writing huge answers", "his video lectures weren't appealing ... and psychology wasn't exactly for me, but his web site was very extensive and helpful especially when u missed a class or two", "No Comments", "Interesting to listen to", "He is a great lecturer, and if you study his stuff, you'll do well.  However, I went and asked him a question four days before an exam, and he told me to 'get lost' and just do the readings.  Some people I know have had similar experiences; he tries to come off approachable, but he doesn't actually want to talk to you...  He was a real jerk.", "Dr. Day is brilliant, clear, organized, and helpful.  His website has a database of sample questions that are invaluable for study, as well as mp3s of the lectures.His sense of humour, concise explanations, and compelling speaking style make the lectures fly. This course, on personality,  is the most interesting I've ever taken.", "Video lectures not all that appealing, however the prof as a person is very helpful! I think he goes above and beyond to help his students. How many profs at mac spend 20% of their coursewear on how to study and how to succeed. A very helpful prof!!!!", "If you have a chance take his personality course, you get to see him in person! Great guy, even posts recordings of his lecture on the course website in case you miss a class.", "I've heard him speak outside of the video lectures and he's a really great guy and I'm sure he's an awesome prof in person but the video lectures bored me! I guess I just don't learn from watching a person on a screen. But the material was interesting and it was a pretty good course overall.", "hard to judge him just from the video lectures, i think theyre boring as hell, just try not to get the  830 lectures.", "Dr.Day the best prof. at Mac. He is willing to help out his students, wants them to suceede but his tests are very very hard, mind you that they are all MC questions.", "Oh, Dr. Dick Day. How I loved it at 8:30AM x 3 in a week! Really the video lectures, I thought, were just bad, didn't learn a thing - except for taste aversion and his experience of peach schnappes as a &quot;youthful university student&quot;! Never going to forget that one!", "Took course ~10 years ago... sure you are still watching Martin Short in the same videos!  Created a great system to teach the country's biggest class at the time (1600 or so was it&#63;).  Your experience then (and now) depends a lot on the quality of your TA.  I was lucky and mine was fabulous.", "Dr. Day is kind and eager to help his students.  His video lectures are actually funny (be sure to watch out for how he's MUCH younger and less bald in the later video lectures, plus the fact that he SMOKED in some of the videos!! hilarious). his exams are hard but there is no shortage of effort on the department's part to help you to understand.", "I took his course so long ago some of you others probably weren't even born yet.  He was amazing.  So much so that I pattern my teaching style after his (yes, I'm rated on this site as well).  Dick, you're the best.", "His exams are quiet tricky and hard but he is a nice prof.", "Probably the best prof at Mac EVER!  Really great attitude!  You gotta love this dude!", "he seems super nice, and like a really cool guy... DICK YOU'RE MY IDOL!!!!!!", "good prof", "Excellent prof, even though I only see him through a tv screen. Very accessible. Maintains a great website and responds to emails remarkably quickly. Great prof overall, and funny too!", "Amazing prof.", "If you've only seen him in the 1A/AA videos, you ain't seen nothin'.  As a lecturer Dr. Day is as good as it gets.  He does his best to make class interesting and enjoyable.  Just don't expect a free ride with 3 multiple choice tests, they aren't easy.", "No Comments", "NO MORE VIDEO LECTURES! THEY ARE 20 YEARS OLD- HAVE YOU SEEN DICK DAY RECENTLY!!! THE CLASS IS GREAT, BUT WE SHOULDNT PAY SO MUCH TO WATCH OLD VIDEOS OF DICK SITTING IN HIS OFFICE 20 YEARS AGO.", "great course", "get ride of the video lectures, it disconnects the students from the elcturer and therefore has an effect on the learning of the material.", "He is awesome, and really helpful", "good prof. Tests/midterm not easy but fair. Do lots of online questions!! Interesting lectures.", "Amazing prof.  Great lecturer.  REALLY nice.  One of the best I've had so far.", "He's cute", "Great guy!", "I think Dr. Day is one of the best lecturers that McMaster has to offer. In this course (Personality) it is not a video, as in intro psych, and his lectures in person are interesting and exciting and made the course come alive. Personality is a great elective and I would recommend for sure!!", "awesome prof, interesting course, and multiple choice weren't that hard. Video lectures could put me to sleep once in a while but courseware was all i needed", "No Comments", "Amazing prof!!", "Great prof, caused me to switch majors into psych. His questions arent as bad as everyone says if you study his practice Q's", "Needs to make tests less difficult.", "His exams are overly hard.", "Loves to trick us with his multiple choice questions.

Lectures were coherent, although exams were difficult. overall a great course to take", "Amazing prof. The video lectures are awesome. So clear!! He's a cool guy.", "Nice guy, easy to talk to, HARD Exams for the Personality course", "the easiest coursee everrrrr. can miss a few classes and it wont matter at all. if u do every question on the online quiz thing ur guranteed a 10.", "amazing", "Yeah.  He's a decent prof.  As long as you study all the material he gives.  Never formally met him.  ONLINE QUIZZES are KEY!", "I wasn't really sure how to rate Dr. Day, however decided on 4's.  His teaching and videos can be interesting, however there is simply no point in going to class to watch them.  You can get A's simply by memorizing the courseware 2 days before the exam.", "Didn't go to class much but I memorized the coursepack.  The exams were pretty tricky and it's a very science related course.", "Loved the class so much. Video lectures make this class a breeze. You never have to worry about missing a class or two. Beats reading 100s of text book pages. The videos are hillarious and the exam isn't tricky if you know your stuff.", "Awesome prof!", "I rarely went to class because the video lectures were so pointless. His multiple choice questions are tricky, so watch out!", "A little sciency, but necessary. following psych classes are much more interesting. would prefer that he teaches live instead of videos. nice guy-very friendly. enjoyed the course.", "Did NOT like this course, too science related. Don't have to go to class, just read coursepack", "Don't bother going to class, just memorize everything in his coursewear.  Projects really bring you up.", "Worst prof I've had this year", "The exams are a killer. Course is interesting. Take this course in the summer with a different prof. You have to be very smart to get a good grade with this prof.", "Worst prof in the history of McMaster. Failure rate in his classes is incredibly high. I wish I never came to McMaster!! Makes me hate psychology so much. Don't take this prof's classes. You WILL regret it.", "After sitting through two whole courses with Dr. Day and writing two of his final exams I will NEVER take a psychology course again. The exams were both extremely difficult, and I found the material to be boring and unhelpful. A big thumbs down.", "It's a shame that we have those video lectures because Dr. Day would likely be a great teacher in person. Whenever you are unsure of something, don't hesitate to go ask him questions. He's very welcoming.", "Sorta makes the best of a bad situation. Videos and MC exams are not a great way to learn. Good memory and guessing skills will lead to good mark.

Did anyone else notice that he has more hair in the 1AA3 lectures&#63;", "No Comments", "These two courses are interesting but difficult. The exams are BRUTAL and tricky. It kind of sucks having to watch all lectures on a screen, it makes the prof seem that much more inaccessible.", "Dr Day is the BEST TEACHER EVER! He really loves his subject and his students. We  want him to be our grandfather... sweetest guy ever! :)", "The best psych class ever, after 1AA3, loved all the personal touches he added to make sense of the material. The info was so interesting that you didn't really have to study", "good", "I LOVE Dr. Dick Day! He is an amazing teacher and a very intelligent man. He breaks things down in his lectures to make them very clear & often provides examples to help you remember. He has made the information available online, and genuinely cares :)", "I see his face on a screen 3 times a week then i see him in person and i feel like i know everthing about him but he doesn't know me at all. you can only take so much of some guys forehead.", "Studied for a total of 30 hours for the both the exam and midterm combined.  Got an A.  Take the class and work on your ability to memorize.

Killer exams.....YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED", "Very helpful teacher, if you go see him!!  I had a few questions, took a trip to his office and he explained them all to me.  Yes the lectures are a little dry and slightly out of date, but all the material is in the courseware!", "hard to rank the prof as you will never see him. only visible through video lectures, some which were filmed 20 years ago. hard to make yourself attend lecture as all important info available in courseware.", "Can you say BORING&#63; Video lectures suck... oh yeah since his lectures are in the custom courseware (basically word for word), no point going to class!!!!", "MOST BORING PROFESSOR AND CLASS I'VE EVER TAKEN!", "this class was a ****ing joke, i mean its a video. what more can i say&#63;", "Very nice guy, funny, good prof, reminds me a lil of Santa Claus hehe", "alright, stilll", "The prof only exists on video! If you have the chance, take the night class and see a real human being speak. Overall, the class was pretty easy but after a couple nights of cramming, the material you learned leaves just as fast as it came.", "He's really good... very funny, makes the class easy to understand and interesting.", "I really enjoyed this class. I thought the video lectures were a great idea. It beat having to sit in a huge lecture hall where half of the time you can't see anything. His stories were a little freaky though.", "He's awesome, he cracks joke in videos and is a really approachable interesting man in person.  I am not a science student and i easily go the material, maybe just put a little effort in and try!", "he is not too bad...eventhough i'm not a science student i can handle the stuff that he throws around quite well...:)", "Sometimes long-winded, can be confusing when he stutters... Would be better in person and not on a video screen...", "I hated this class! Too technical--steer clear!", "dick day represent yeah yeah video prof what&#63;!", "How can he ever be called &quot;helpful&quot; when he refuses to meet with first year students!! Arrogant and rude - and at times vulgar. BEWARE! first year students!!", "He seems nice... on video.", "No Comments", "if i wanted bio i would have signed up for bio", "Dr. Day's course was fun and easy, but it might be challenging for non science students.  Study and learn the material inside out, rather than memorizing questions from previous tests.", "How are other people saying that Day is difficult and unhelpful&#63;  His courses are only easy because of the relative facility with which he makes the transitions from topic to topic.  In my opinion, this guy is the epitome of what all professors should", "not helpful, yet teaches easy  classes.", "Not fun at all. Takes the fun out of psychology. Terribly boring. Difficult exams/tests", "Worst prof ever. Tests are too difficult. Avoid him if you possibly can", "LOVE DICK DAY", "No Comments", "Tests are very thorough..challenging and demanding - gotta know your stuff upside down like REALLY well.

example of a guy who is obviously extremely intelligent, but ask for an explanation and goodluck to you, it will seem as though he is speaking Mandarin.

And finally does not use textbook so go to class", "Good lecturer. Found the quizzes hard sometimes.", "This class was fair, as were the midterms and final. You only need to study from your class notes (no textbook) and professor Bruce is very clear with what he expects from students. I feel like he is a genius but he comes across as very laid back and non-personable which can make economics VERY dry.

Very very clear in his teaching, no need for the text book just show up to every class. You're paying for it anyway! Fair, clear, concise and knows very well what he is teaching. Every horror story about I've heard about Stats has been dispelled through his class.", "he knows what hes talking about and he doesn't fool around... you definitely will not need the text book.. i dont think i opened it once. you basically have to attend class becuase he does not post his lectures and every lecture he will be covering an important topic. over all hes a good prof", "Good sense of humor, class notes are basically what is on the tests/exam. Pretty easy course..", "brilliant man, don't need the textbook he explains everything well and only tests what he teaches you.  felt so bad for him tho, b/c most of the students in this class were useless and blamed him for their poor grades", "James Bruce, What a guy! it's so hard describing how amazing he is in 350 words but here it goes. James Bruce is a man's man, when you learn with james you have to be smart, because he has no time for losers. why you may ask&#63; Simple. He's a winner and always will be.

His lectures were so confusing and his monotone voice made it really hard to focus! My friends explained the stuff better than he did,I would have been totally clueless if they didn't help me. I should've paid them instead of him!He was a Waste of time!!", "The most easy going guy I have ever met in my life. You would never guess he was a prof by looking at him.

Tests were fair. The class only had 1 test and a final, which made the two quite stressful since there were no assignments to fall back on.", "Great guy. To the guys saying he's clueless in class, he really knows what he's doing. He might say he forgot something, or &quot;what did we do last class&#63; hmmm&quot; but he really does know I think.

If you have a choice, pick Bruce ... He is one of the best in the economics department at McMaster.", "Great prof, taken 3 classes with him. ALWAYS available to help one on one. Explains things clearly and in a detailed manner. His classes tend to be a little heavy on the math...he'll help you throught it, but if you can't do math then economics isnt for you. Sample tests are VERY helpful, if you do them you dont even need to buy the text. Great Guy", "Soc Sci 2J03- Don't bother going to lectures for this course, his notes are posted online, word for word! Use the online website on how to do the assignments and to prepare for the tests and exam. Most unorganized prof ever, but friendly and approachable.", "Sometimes his examples were not clear and hard to follow.  Bad at responding to emails.  Final exam was quite easy.", "I can see he's a real econ geneis but he CANT teach.  He always gets lost while lecturing.  Yet, tests r completely irrelevant to what he covers in class + txtbk (like 1/4 questions)  The tests r particularly hard and the class avg was amazingly LOW.  However, I wont deny that his lectures notes are really good despite they arent helpful for study", "BRUTAIL", "Lazy guy, un-responsible, unorganized lecture, hard test.

Anyone who complains about him should sit in on other economics classes!", "Can you spell p-a-t-h-e-t-i-c&#63; He is one of those teachers that know their stuff but when they teach it to first years, they address you in language suitable for fourth years. So although he has a clear voice, nobody ever understands what he is saying. This is actually one course where i had to learn it from the text book. He also sweats a lot.", "Just go to class, everything on tests is mentioned aforehand", "HARD TESTS!!! b on the lookout for unusual teaching methods...he could highlight important material more or help a bit more before the tets", "No Comments", "Has nice handwriting on the overheads; large print and neat graphs. Good voice. Sometimes explanations are too complicated, probably because he's really smart with economics. Don't blame him if you don't do well, it's the material that's the problem.

Pauses too much. Tests a tad on the tough side. That being said, he's a really smart guy and knows his stuff.", "I love the last post! Was that him&#63; Either way it's so true.", "Man, Bruce is the coolest (i'm so worried i'll gush), he's so funny and un-lame, and really kepts things alive - i second that he'd be a rad dude to go for a beer with.", "he's my favourite although his tests are too hard.

He tries so hard to help you, and he is also always available. Great person.", "Really really bad... he had no clue what he was writing in his exams. We'd go over the exam in class and he'd notice all these mistakes in his own work!!

Classes were alot more useful than textbook. Notes are useful for tests. Asking him questions about test are pointless. Doesn't know material very well.

"comments": ["Super nice and a great teacher, fuelled my passion and love for classics! If you have him for a prof definitely go see him for help or just to talk to!", "He was awful. Seems like a nice enough person but his pretentious British accent and his tendency to use words that over complicate a simple concept was extremely irritating. I enjoy history courses but he made it difficult for me to go to class due to me essentially having to sit through the reading of an essay. He was not at all charismatic.", "Coming to lecture was a chore; very boring. The content was only saved by my amazing TA; without her I would've hated the class and done very badly. Corner talks a lot and doesn't care much for the opinion of others at all or trying to be helpful. Unapproachable professor but the class is an easy pass.", "INCREDIBLY boring. Made an interesting subject tedious and really hard. He speaks like he's in constant poetry and he's hard to understand. All around he could be alright, but the class was too tough for his teaching style.", "AMAZING! super passionate about classics and just an overall amazing speaker, best lectures ever ", "AMAZING! the best lectures I have ever been to, he is very passionate and just an amazing speaker", "The lectures were super boring. In the lectures  you will notice he says one sentence and repeats three times saying the same thing in different words.  ", "So, I thought this class would be really great, turns out, the prof was the absolute worst. I couldn't follow a thing he said, the power points were so hard to follow. He is a complete ass, and pretentious beyond belief. I really don't understand why anyone would enjoy his lecture. They were possibly the worst I've ever sat through. ", "High Level Thinking translates to ridiculous comparisons with modernity. Most class time was spent  explaining what was said in the first ten minutes. Notable classes included thirty minute exposes of how a plastic chair embodied the theories of physical reality. Thinking this high needs more than books", "The material is challenging, the reading list laborious, the midterms and exam difficult, but the enjoyment I drew from the work was equally great. Corner is a fantastic orator, eloquent and emphatic, missing lecture is only depriving yourself; his feedback on work is detailed and extensive; very willing to discuss. High expectations are the norm.", "Interesting lecture content. Very knowledgeable prof. The course was easy if you did majority of the work. ", "Nice guy, but really high level thinker. Not easy to follow and the classes were really tedious. The Exam was alright, but the whole class became confusing and I dreaded the tutorials. I never want to hear the word \"Tiberius\" ever again", "The most energetic professor I had in my first year. He does not spoon feed his students and sets very high standards (as he should, seeing as it is university). Though he speaks quite fast, his lectures are very clear. If you are truly passionate about classics or history, this is a professor you must go for. Don't underestimate him, however.", "Dr. Corner is a wonderful man, a uniquely gifted mind and in possession of a deep kindness. Though his expectations are very high, as they should be (and you must expect to work diligently), his understanding and willingness to work with students would seem to be boundless, do make use of his office hours for he is an eminently personable man.", "He was impossible to listen to. High level thinker, not a lecturer. He was complex in his wording and hard to follow. I'll end up failing this course because my notes were so all over the place at his random speech and otherwise", "Lectures were unbearable. He basically read an essay. Very boring. Way to much information that we were never tested on. Fortunately, I had a great TA, but I would have dropped the course otherwise.", "Horrible prof! Was so excited for this class and instead was bored to death by his lectures. Slides were super unclear and often gave up on keeping up with notes and instead played minesweeper. Also I don't think it is natural to sweat that much.", "Professor is very monotonous, very boring, extremely slow. Does not engage well with the material, is not a very good orator. Tutorials in this class are a life saver.", "dr corners lectures are soooooooooo boring, and i mean boring!!!! i don't think anyone in my class found his lectures to be clear or easy to follow. he seems like a nice man, but really boring teacher.", "Corner is awesome, he's funny, passionate and helpful. There was only ONE class where I had a hard time following him because he was going quickly. He was always willing to help me or just chat. I always take his classes when I can.", "Dr. Corner is amazing! One of the best! Clear, but in depth lectures. Helpful and sharply dressed!  Always approachable and incredibly nice! Take anything he teaches! Thank-you for a great term.", "Brilliant professor. Extremely easy to understand, knows everything about the topic being taught. Entertaining, friendly, one of the best history/classics professors at McMaster.", "This course was fantastic!!! It truly is his world. His lectures were clear, and the slides were helpful. At times we would be behind, causing confusion, but because the lectures were soo in depth. There were alot of text books for the course. In short, take anything offered by him, he is truly talented, and one of the best in the department. :O)", "Professor Corner is truly a unique talent, and a natural one as well. A natural pedagogue (meant in the positive sense) if ever there was one.", "Yet, again, another fabulous term with Dr. C! Although, he tends to be biased with authors, he explains why. Beware, seminars become lectures, expect a 10% drop in grade, because he, himself is a tough marker. Expects ALOT from his students in seminar. But is always eager to help with anything. THANK-YOU DR. CORNER! ;O)", "Another great course with Professor Corner. This guy is the reason I changed to Classics. His class this year was a little harder. The final exam could have had a little more choice. Lectures were fascinating as usual. Beware though, the TAs in Classics at MAC are horrid markers. Make sure to get your tests/essays remarked by the Dr. Corner.", "Simply brilliant.  HE deals with very profound and complex concepts, yet, he explains them with ease.  Slides are useful, texts are interesting, and lectures are organized SO well.", "Dr.Corner was fantastic! He has high expectations but if you have problems or concerns he addresses them. He was always willing to help and explain things so clear. This is my 3rd class with him and I never get bored, though sometimes it is hard to focus in lecture because they sound exactly like a textbook. Shine on! Nice shirts, awesome accent!", "useless, not a leader, not helpful, no clean instructions on assignments. pretentious poser in  a paisley shirt.", "No Comments", "Dr. Corner is AMAZING. He is a fantastic lecturer, his shirts are awesome,everything that comes out of his mouth is soo eloquent and coherent. One of the gems of the classics department.

ROCK ON!", "Dr. Corner is an amazing professor. His lectures are fantastic and it sounds like he practices for hours.", "The best prof MAC has to offer. Very approachable, excellent lecturer. Not only is he a nice guy, he is easy on the eyes.", "Dr. Corner is by far the finest professor that I have. His lectures are phenomenal, he is very knowledgeable, and listening to him speak is like candy for your ears. If I wasn't enrolled in this class, I would still come to his lectures because they really are amazing. He is not afraid to answer questions either. He also has a nice wardrobe.", "Dr. Corner is awesome. He is an amazing lecturer and a very nice, helpful person. His fantastic paisley shirts keep things colourful.", "Leads fascinating lectures. It's like watching an addictive history documentary! Imagine!", "Interesting course but a lot of reading...great prof!", "Dr. Corner is an amazing professor! He is so clear and has a true passion for what he does. His voice a bonus! His shirts keep you awake when you look at them! One of the best professors in the Classics department at Mac! I hope I have him for many more classes! :)", "Excellent prof, very passionate. And the accent...the man could read the classifieds and make them sound sexy.", "Great prof! He's brilliant and brings a lot of knowledge to the lecture, which can sometimes be overwhelming. But he's always open to questions, too. He's friendly and approachable, and also really hot.", "Far and away the most knowledgeable, most friendly, most helpful and most charismatic professor I have had. He inspired me to further studies in ancient history and remains a friend. Lectures so clear and dramatic I still have 3 saved on my PC. Awesome.", "Awesome prof. It's all about the shirts!!\r \r Cheers!", "Well what can I say, the man is brilliant and is passionate about his work.  He was very helpful in this class, and gives very good feedback on your work.  He raises interesting questions and brings up interesting topics for discussion..Take note of the paisley shirts!", "oh.. corner... what will we say about you&#63;", "He is very smart but he jumps all over the place in his lectures. It is hard to pay attention throughout the whole class because there is just TOO much information.....at least 4 pages of notes every class....plus copying down the overhead.", "This dude is smart. He really knows his stuff and he has a ton of passion for his topic. Door is always open if you have a question. Teaching methods need some refining. His lectures are VERY complex but he pushes you to think beyond conventional methods. In that sense, his teaching is very innovative. You will either hate or love his classes.", "watch him while u talk!", "he was a brand new professor last year, so of course it was going to be difficult for him in the beginning.  I tried hard to follow him, but had a hard time understanding where he was going with certain points.  It is clear that he has a real passion for Classics, so that was admirable but I do hope he gets a better teaching methods.", "Expected way too much for the midterm. Jumped around alot and until he started using overheads, it was really hard to understand him. He made me lose interest in ancient history - horrible prof. But, he is new, so maybe he'll be better as he gets more expirence.", "He's an amazing lecturer...I learned so much from him!  All of you who don't understand his lectures, must not go to class.  For a professor who hasn't finished his phd...he's doing great!!", "One of the worst Profs I have ever had.  he made me totally lose interest in ancient history.  He truely sucks!", "Classes are a form of narative and his smooth sultry voice can keep a girl intrigued...", "Sometimes different to understand his dialect, but brilliant.  He is knowledgeable and puts a big emphasis on why ancient history matters and how it can be applied to our present day.  -n Very interesting prof - To some he seems to be all over the place, but I was able to follow him perfectly fine.", "No Comments", "This guy is smart, and knows his****. This means that he can effectively destroy those of us who don't do our readings with one &quot;hulk smash&quot;. Take philosophy before taking his class; you'll need it to understand him. Also, I like the pink shirt. He can pull it off and it is definitely his colour.", "I found Dr. Corner to be unclear for half of the term. He's helpful though. The assignments weren't bad, either. I ended up doing pretty ok in the class, so I'm not going to complain. Dr Corner: Shine on, you crazy diamond!", "awesome, be sure to stay awake cuz if u take good notes from his lectures, they're great to study for the exam.  especially when he got to the greek stuff, he was on fire.  i think the course needs its own website tho, for outlines and posting lecture notes/material.", "No Comments", "Dr. Corner is a wonderful professor.  This man is brilliant, he defenitly knows his****.  The lectures were sometimes a little dull, but hey, thats the material, not him.  He was always enthusiastic and extremely helpful whenever I asked him for assistance.  Plus, he is freakin' HOT!!", "To all of those above who commented about finding his lecture materials too hard-if you think that's too hard, you're a brainless moron not fit for university. His lectures are unique, engaging and enthusiastic, always fun to attend. He's open for suggestions and always available to help. A winner!", "One of the best professors I've had thus far. He's extremely approachable and a genuinely nice person. The class is fabulous and as long as you do your preparations, you should do fine. The shirts are a little sketchy, but all in all, Dr. Corner is great.", "I have to say i like the shirts, and now that he's started with the overheads lectures are really good.  This is his first year so i'm not surprised that he had a problem or too but he DEFINITELY knows what he's talking about...and being hot with a majorly hot accent helps", "Crap", "The worst class I have ever attended in my life!  I can't believe I'm paying to be lulled to sleep by this moron.  His lectures are dull and hard to follow.  the material provided for the essay is hard to read, and the stupid website that had our assignment on never works properly.", "i find the class pretty interesting most times when i go. Im just sorry i missed the 'randy' lecture", "For the first part of the term, I could never follow what he was saying at all. He even apologized to our class for being unclear.", "His shirts are more interesting than his lectures. His pwr to teach a class is extremely poor and unpwrful. May Inana infuse him with the pwr he needs, cause Inana only knows he does need it.", "Professor Corner is hot as a D", "Corner is a beautiful boy", "By far the worst professor I have ever had.  His lectures are dull, and he never highlights what is important.  His lectures seem to jump around alot & they don't follow any definable pattern.  His lectures don't give me anything I can't get from a textbook.  A lecture should clarify information.", "Dr Corner is amazing. Not only are his shirts fantastic, but he is extremely approachable & more than willing to answer questions. He uses suggestions & lectures are interesting & easy to follow if you pay attention & do the readings.", "I think that he jumps around a lot and he confuses me. However, if people have problems he seems to answer them on the spot.", "Corner is a difficult teacher to follow, and his lectures aren't particualrly fascinating, however his suave english charm and shirts that are reminiscient of a kaleidoscope earn him huge points in my books. Sean likes yorkshire pudding, snooker, and can", "What the hell is everyone else thinking! Corner's the worst professor I ve ever had. I took his class cause I loved 1LL3 but I and the entire class can't follow let alone understand his lectures! I cant believe I am paying to put myself through his class!", "I love this class, and Corner makes it just THAT much  better. His lectures are always interesting and informative, and he has a sense of humour and is approachable. The perfect combination.

such a great professor, he has helped me many times.  I once went to his office during his office hours for help and he went above and beyond.  I was broken up with my girlfriend for over three months and I haven't had any liquid relief for a while.  When I went to this professor, he helped me with my assignment and also hand relief.", "Professor Kovarik is the greatest prof.  He puts his time, mind and soul into teaching and really cares about his students.  He made Mathematics fun for me and I am greatly thankful to him forever and always.", "Dr. Kovarik is a decent teacher with a very calm and kind demeanor. His tests were fair (not too easy or hard). Was not perfectly clear when teaching some concepts, but with supplemental textbook reading, class notes were useful.", "Though a tad bit difficult to follow at times, he is a great prof, and what makes him great is his willingness to help the students. A lot of professors don't care about the questions their students ask, but he really is willing to answer any question. I thought his tests are very fair, and people only complain because they don't wanna do the work.", "He is the easiest math professor in the history of this university. He has no consideration for academic integrity and makes very easy quizzes. He is throwing free credit for the math 3g3 course. He is also an incredibly easy marker. Shame on him for being so easy. He is really ruining what a math degree has to offer students- brainstorming skills", "Very poor teaching skills. Talks to himself. Low attendance in his lectures. Avoid this prof. People don't like him.", "He needs to go easier on students. For an old person one would think he would care for his students like he cares for his grandchildren, but that is not the case at all.", "He is a really tough professor. The quizzes were so tough.", "What a great professor. He is so great in teaching. He explained concepts upside down and inside out. He actually made you understand it, his teaching style was marvellous.", "He's cute. It looks like he works out a lot.", "Very tough prof. U have to be genius to pass his course.", "Absolutely the worst professor ever. His teaching is very bad and his exams are unfair. Terrible experience overall.", "terrible teaching. Very unclear during lectures and writes really challenging tests. Not fair!!!", "He is the worst PROF EVER!! If he does not want to help a student, he will not answer your email even. He is so rude that he even ignores people's emails sometimes. He needs to have the courtesy that if someone emailed him, atleast he should answer back. His teaching is unclear and his tests and exams are very very hard. Good luck if you have him.", "I agree. He is one of the best profs around.", "Oh, I learned so much from this prof.

His teaching style is &quot;Talk to the blackboard&quot;, he has major Issues!!! There are rumours circulating he is teaching Math 3C03 next year, save yourself the Agony, DONOT register in any of his courses. Taking his courses will be your biggest nightmare.", "The multiple choice questions that he asks are ****ed up", "I enjoyed his class thoroughly. Great guy, sweet sense of humour.

Had to remind him when our tests were, but overall his &quot;recipes&quot; made calculus easy!", "Useless teaching, Hard tests, Overall bad prof.", "Very tough course", "worst prof ever, seriously stay away from him and any course he teaches!!!", "Best professor I have ever had. He is very nice when u see him during office hour and he is welcoming and helpful.", "Bad prof. poor testing. His multiple choice are tough. Avoid this professor otherwise you will regret it. He does not give good marks!", "I knew after the first lecture I would never attend his lectures again. I've had him 3 times, and I think the reason I did well is because I didn't attend. Besides, who walks around campus in a safari hat and suspenders &#63;", "Goes too fast, and his lectures leave you confused", "Oi. What are you talking about, Kovarik&#63; Get a little organized.", "In all seriousness, this guy is the worst prof. His tests are ridiculously hard, 1 multiple choice worth 5 marks, he often puts questions that weren't covered in detail in class. His evaluation style is weird. He seems like a nice guy, but his teaching is unclear, and his tests are kind of stupid.

He's all over the place keeping you confused. Then people get incredibly low marks on tests.", "Bad teaching, his handwriting is not good, no interaction with the class, lectures all over the blackboard leaving you confused as to what's going on, and very hard tests. Test questions different from homework problems, MUCH TOUGHER IN FACT", "Easy tests, hard final exam!", "Very well organized website. Tests are fair if you actually did the homework and knew your stuff.", "This prof skips steps, talks to the board as well as expects you to already know all the material before teaching! He seems to be very condescending. But he DOES seem to love the subject&#63;", "Nice guy, knows a lot, but can't teach.  Seems to like the most complicated way of explanation.  It should be pretty telling that every class I've had him for, the average was fairly low.", "EXCELLLENT PROFESSOR", "Boring and the tests are tough. Maybe just the course is tough.", "Hard to understand, boring, and MAN are his answer notes (more like brief summarys) condesending", "Not bad. The midterms were fair. Hope the final will not be too difficult.", "He was great. His tests and quizzes were totally fair. If you did the homework carefully you would have no problem in them.", "He is the most angel prof I have ever met. I am so glad I took his course. He is polite, reasonable, and writes fair tests. He's the man.", "A great professor no doubt, but more than that an exceptional sweet human being. The multiple choice on his tests are a little tough though.", "Greatest teacher I have ever had", "He's a very nice guy!!!", "He is kind, caring professor, has big heart. Gave us good sample final exam. TA Jason Haradyn very helpful and always eager to provide extra help. One of the best teachers ever had", "He's probably different in the summer... but during the year.... let's just say the class started off with over 200 people, and by the end, i'm not even sure there were even 2 people left. But i feel sorry for him cause he really does try, and he kinda cute - he looks like santa claus.. lol! And his jokes are pretty dumb, which makes them funny.", "AWESOME", "Cutest professor ever. Fair tests, HARD exam. If you don't go to class, you'll find his final very hard. Especially the multiple choice questions on his exams are tough.", "Very dedicated prof. Knows his stuff upside down.", "Hard to understand...I took the course in the summer, and I found his teaching style reflected an &quot;upgrade course&quot; style. Flew through the material rather quickly as well because he mostly did examples...I found myself having to go back and teach myself. He does care however, and makes every effort to have fair tests.", "Awesome!", "Very cute professor and cares about his students", "Dr. Kovarik is the most helpful and one of the most intelligent math professors at mcmaster university.

I really enjoyed his classes and his respect for his students.", "The course is designed with lots of focus on the lecture slides as well as various info from the textbook.

Replied every e-mail I have sent.", "Great teacher and examples given throughout lectures are very helpful. Take him because the other profs aren't better than him.", "One of the best profs I've had.. Pre chilled guy and even though attendance is not mandatory if you attend his class and do the work given in class you would get an easy A without doing any work outside his class...", "He is the best prof I had at mac. gives you a lot of real examples in the real business world. I hate classes that are only based on theory and I can not relate them to a real situation.  I learned a lot about my future business either in accounting or any other field of management and commerce.", "The summarized notes (transcripts as he calls them) are the best I have ever seen. All profs should produce these.", "The professor was excellent. I liked how he would interact casually even in an online class. I liked having lots of practice questions available to us.

A bit corny at times. Very hard quizzes.", "I miss him in accounting. iw ish he were teaching the managerial class too", "Aadil makes me excited for a 3 hour Wednesday night lecture. He made me in-hate accounting and made things so clear. 6/5 if I could, Best prof at McMaster.", "Oh man I am graduating from McMaster (my final semester of Commerce) and I realize how much this prof was the greatest prof I had. I had him for half of 2AA3 and 2AB3 back in Fall 2013 and Winter 2016. I feel like going into one of hias 1AA3 lectures this term to relive it. Hands down best prof I had in Commerce, clear concise and I respect him", "He is funny and caring towards his students. He can be very strict with troublemakers and distractors and yet be able to joke and refer to his students with lots of respect. Also responds to emails at all times.

Very concise in his lectures and helps the class with what they struggle with.", "Aadil makes me want to get up in the morning.", "Do whatever you can to get into Aadil's class.

Really a gem of a person.", "Enjoyed his classes.", "I found Mr. Juma was always encouraging. He pushed his students to go that extra step.

Funny, caring and bright.", "I found the second half of the course more interesting. The first part on statements was pretty intense for four weeks. I liked variance the most from last class. I had a bad feeling about this course going in but the prof quickly changed my mind after the first class.", "I really liked the professor and class the most. The only downside was that sometimes the professor would engage with students who asked d umb questions such as not understanding grading schemes and mark breakdown or questions that had been just answered. This wasted time for other students. The prof. should dismiss such silly questions.", "Met with me weekly and prepared a study plan for me. Followed through with me and made sure I was keeping up. I have failed this course before and would fail it again if it was not for his dedication to the lesson plan.", "Great prof but I don't get why we need to learn accounting. This prof would be better placed teaching technical courses. He has an Engineering background. He is wasting his skills on accounting.", "my favorite prof", "Hard course but entertaining instructor.

I don't know how I would pass if I didn't go to his classes.", "Frankly I didn't like the blender format at all. I think I learnt more from this prof than trying to learn it myself.

This prof makes a boring course very animated and interesting.", "Genuinely the best prof I've ever had.", "I liked the in class exercises during the two hours section. The pace of the course was a bit too fast. Would love to have you as a prof. in a future course. The course is hard but useful. Experiences shared with class very resourceful. Also allows us some control over grade weighting thus respecting our time.", "Juma is caring and effective instructor. if it wasn't for this prof, I would have failed the course.

Time frame for case study was short. Quizzes biweekly was good. Overall good.", "Good way to make students learn. Smart instructor.", "Funny guy....I wish the classes were face2face than online. I really don't feel the subject matter is suitable for online classes. You are still my favorite prof so far in the prog. :)", "He spoke about the learning portfolio in class and he said that sometimes students dont give enough credit for stuff they do.

One of my best courses and you're my favourite prof. Thanks for keeping in touch.", "The best prof Ive had at Mac so far. He respects his students and is very approachable.

He is technically sound and very helpful. His experience in industry makes for good relationship between the content and the examples.", "The explanation was easy to understand.

Too bad he only teaches 2  courses in commerce.", "amazing prof, i actually look forward to going to his lectures every week", "Your test 1 was very fair. The questions on the written part were very similar to tutorial problems like you promised. Thanks for posting such detailed statistics on our performance. I didn't do as well but that was my fault because I could not study enough. I love your lectures :))", "Yes, Juma is an amazing prof but he does things in 2AB3 that really upset me. sir you were an amazing prof but intimidated alot of students by saying 40% of the class will finish with a D Yes your tutorials are good but you make your tests MUCH harder. you're short answer question for midterm 1 Q2 extrmlly unfair.

Textbook is a must.", "Harrison skips all the complicated concepts while focusing on those that are straightforward (which we already know). I recommend reading the textbook, it was a lot more helpful. His tests are also extremely difficult, and assignments often mis-marked.", "Not a very good prof...more useful one-on-one (but still not very good). As the course went on, his lecturing worsened and he became harder to follow. The midterm was not easy, but fair. He writes a brutal final exam, though...He really expects too much out of us. Textbook definitely helped in understanding the concepts, so buy it.", "Paul Harrison, in my opinion, is a pretty good professor! If you go to class, and pay attention to what he is lecturing about, you will do just fine.  He is a pretty nice guy, and likes to help out people when they need it, as well as try and lighten the mood in class when things get dull, with a joke or two.  If you just practice, you will be fine", "I don't understand why people don't like Harrison! His exams are tough, definitely, but ultiamtely doable. I loved going to his lectures because he is really funny and enjoyable. Yes, you have to read the textbook, because it's a content heavy course and he doesn't have time to go through each detail in class. Overall, great prof.", "The course itself has lots of content and necessitates a CONCEPTUAL approach (DON'T MEMORIZE). The assignments and midterms were fair (may be even easy) BUT the exam is very difficult as the material covered is extensive. He is a mediocre lecturer and in retrospect I would have benefited more if I has simply read the book and not gone to class", "His lectures were dull and somewhat useless. Reading the textbook was essential. His tests were easy and exam was fair if you put effort into this class. Tutorials were lifesavers!", "Skips through slides during lecture. Stuck 2 chapters in on the last day of class. Impossible exam. Good luck.", "His tests are very undoable", "Very awkward.

Also, he makes HARD tests.", "The textbook teaches better than the professor himself. He frequently skips slides, which causes a lot of confusion. He also makes extremely hard tests.", "This professor lacks the ability to teach this course properly and thoroughly. He skips slides very often and he can't even answer questions that were on his assignments.", "Literally said something would not be on the final exam and then it showed up on the final. Helpful if you confront him in person but don't try asking \"extension\" questions with him, he'll simply say \"I don't know\" or tell you it's not relevant to the course. Lectures are very poor because he skips SO many slides. Textbook is a must.", "This professor makes hard tests, confuses people when he teaches because he skips slide constantly. If he tells you something that is not going to be on the test, then make sure you study that. Good luck.", "Lectures were disorganized and confusing. His testing is ridiculously hard. Studied very hard but he makes it impossible to do well in the course.", "One of the worst.", "Not a very good teacher. Would skip several slides at a time and say they weren't important. Always swore, which apparently is funny. His tests were verbatim from old tests, so using old tests as a study guide work well.", "Gives a brutally hard midterm and an insanely impossible final. All questions are connected, so if you can't get the first part of a question, and the last question asks you to draw a detailed mechanisms of your final reaction, you're screwed!! A VERY difficult class. Use your textbook because it is surprisingly really good.", "SKIPS SLIDES TOO OFTEN during lectures... made me feel like he wasn't explaining things to the fullest. Not a very good lecturer overall, hard to follow his train of thought.", "Always at least 1 hilarious moment/comment per lecture. Disorganized with concepts. BUT he does make rounds to the labs/help centres to check up on students. Agree with the other person, can't make tests at an appropriate level for the course. Too hard.", "I never heard such dirty language coming from a teacher!  Mac is a great school and I don't expect anything less than professional profs. He's soooo boring and never quite understands when you ask a question.", "I thought he was a great prof.  Really approachable.  Nice guy.", "Great prof. Course is hell.", "Very, very funny - and a fairly decent prof to boot. Love the alcohol jokes. Tough course though.", "He's actually a much easier marker than Valliant, gives marks for anything. And very, very funny. I enjoyed him.", "Runs around the from of the class rambling on about you don't know what since he never properly introduces a topic.  You figure out what he's talking about half way through it.  God forbid you ask him a question, or he'll ramble on about something unrelated for 15 min.

"comments": ["Not a great prof at all. SO disorganized. He knows his flaws (in terms of teaching style and not explaining well enough) but he refuses to fix the flaws. Some people do well in the course because he repeats questions from the test banks. I believe he has retired tho, so yay!", "He was better at explaining things in office hours. Just read the textbook and go to his office hours, use your friend's help on the in class quizzes. After all that, just hope for a decent mark", "dont take it unless you have to.", "He is a terrible lecturer but his tests come from the courseware. So his poor teaching is reflected on the tests. he's not like other profs who suck and then butcher you on the exams. I want to have him again, if you study the courseware you'll get at least a 10", "He is extremely hard to follow, the amount of mistakes in his courseware is copious, and the exam has nothing in common with midterms/courseware.", "Lectures are not helpful at all.  Too many errors in courseware.", "If you get sick for a period of time and have to miss any classes you'll be screwed because his evening section has a quiz or test every week.  His lectures are long and monotonous, involving him simply doing the math behind problems for two hours.  He doesn't explain any sort of theory behind the work. He changed the exam format at the last minute", "Do not take his evening microeconomics class; poorly run class with terrible instruction.", "In short:  1) Lectures are useless and boring 2) Courseware has a multitude of typos that confuse students trying to learn the math 3) He reuses questions from his courseware, yes, but he changes them 4) Work is easy but hard to understand properly, you may think you're right but you're actually wrong 5) His exams are brutally hard", "Lol I swear going to class confuses you more... IF YOU TAKE HIS CLASS DONT ATTEND LECTURE JUST READ THE COURSEWARE", "There was no structure to his course, let alone his lectures. His courseware was full of errors and he was behind in his lectures. Lost a lot of quizzes, not to mention the amount of errors he made in recording our marks. Overall, too much work for a course I didn't learn anything from. Take it with another professor if you have to!! ", "Terrible prof, hard to understand and doesnt have any notes or powerpoint slides. His courseware is full of errors.", "Worst Teacher Ever.. ", "He is not a greater lecturer but his tests are pretty easy. His test questions are very similar to his practice questions in the course pack. Take his courses if you just care about a good grade rather than learning new content. ", "please do yourself a favour and get out of this class, such a great guy but his courseware isn't legible and nobody can understand him", "perfect", "Pretty bad lecturer but he recycles questions and it's easy to do well in his classes. Take it if you're more interested in your grade than in learning the actual material. ", "No need to go to classes, only need to read the courseware and do the practise quiz and tests, got A+", "terrible course with a terrible prof. his lecture is useless as his courseware. the best advice is to drop his class as soon as possible. his accent and his poor clarity make most students hard to understand. REALLY REALLY TERRIBLE.", "The most abysmal professor I've ever had at McMaster University. This class was so poorly taught I would recommend anybody who has Khan as a professor to immediately drop the class and avoid the utter waste of time. The subject itself has so much potential, but it is ruined by this prof who is incapable of teaching, organizing, and speaking audibly", "disliked the class and the prof. easiest class though, he makes sure you do well ", "Awesome Prof. Really cares about his students, and will take time to help you if you approach him with a question. Holds a pizza party at the end of the year for the entire class. I understood economics much better because of his class.", "Great professor! He explains the materials clearly and the course ware that he published had clear examples!", "He is so easy just because he reuses his questions from the coursepack. No need to even read the notes. All my studying consisted of redoing and memorizing all of the previous quizzes and tests.  I studied the day before and I got A-.I probably could have gotten higher if I tried harder or came to class (only came for the quizzes) but whatever :P.", "his courseware is whack. lots of spelling, grammar, math errors, and incongruent. not a good lecturer,but the sample tests make it an easy ride.", "Easy to get a good grade but the lectures felt like a waste.", "Helpful", "This professor is HIGHLY ideologically subversive. He essentially lays the course out as a defense of contemporary socialist economic policy. He is fraught with logical fallacy. Aside from this, he is funny and intelligent assist in instruction of class and obtaining high grades.", "Easy marks with tons of previous tests. His book is helpful in understanding the materials, but his lecture is a joke. Most ppl go to the class is just because of the bonus quizzes.", "Dr. Khan is one of the few profs who really cares about his students. His courseware is really clear and concise, everything you need to do well in the course is in there. He doesn't just analyze things graphically, he does it algebraically too, to help you understand the language of economics.", "He's an O.K prof if you want to get a decent mark,bBut you will be teaching yourself the entire course. You will also be behind when you take the extension 2HH3 course. If you are actually interested in learning and being educated, he is a joke of a prof.", "Khan really had a way of making relatively easy topics more complicated than they actually are. He seems like a great guy but his teaching skills are lacking. He speaks unclearly and his courseware is vague & has many mistakes. I paid good money for it, so I'd at least expect it to be proofread. He does give a lot of easy bonus quizzes though.", "ANY COURSE WITH HIM IS 12 ABLE", "Great professor. I dont understand all the negativity towards him. He doesnt make you buy the book, but rather a cheap course ware (even though he published it better than $150 book). Tells you exactly whats on the test. Very open, honest, and kind heart. A+", "He's pretty horrible, to be completely honest.  A nice man with a good heart, but falls short when it comes to explaining concepts.  He tells you what you need to know for the tests/quizzes and gives you an opportunity to do well in the class, but I found that even though I did very well, I didn't feel like a learned much of anything.", "You will not get a better prof then this guy. I took a class with him about 8 years ago, I came back to comment on this because he will teach you more then economics. You know he gets his questions from the study guide. Most profs get there questions from somewhere. Find out where! Practice those questions and understand the material. Youllaceever", "I dont think that anyone should get less than 10 in his class.", "He's hard to understand with a thick accent, messy writing and disorganizedish teaching, but that's besides the point. He pretty much gives you what's going to show up on the tests  right from the courseware/textbook and gives you lots of free marks. You can't say he isn't fair, you just have to practice the material and do some reading", "Alright guys, you gotta be fair to him.  He is a little hard to understand but he does give you a LOT of sample tests.  Trust me, there are many profs out there who are both unclear AND unfair.", "Absolutely cannot teach, if it wasn't for his course ware (which provides a ton of previous tests and quizzes) most people would fail his classes", "very hard to understand in class and super disorganized class notes but....he gives you a ton of practice tests in the coursware which are very useful( he often uses the same questions for tests) and if you attend class he does a lot of bonus assignments to help everyone out.. good guy overall will take his classes again", "Good guy", "A thick accent and tends to ramble, but if you listen to what he's saying and don't attempt to just follow along with the courseware, you'd find that he's actually extremely helpful when explaining things. One of the nicest professors at McMaster.", "Do not expect clean, organized class notes. Attend your lectures (gives TONNES of bonus marks from bonus quizzes/tests) and read off course pack, and you will sure get nice grades", "Disorganized, inconsistent pace, knowledgeable, scary.  Read the material prior to the lectures to have a clear understanding on what he is teaching. Ask for help when needed--gives clear explanations. The courseware is enough to get an A in this class.", "I don't know why people bash Khan -- he's a really nice, genuine guy and his lectures are bearable; a lot better than some other econ profs. He does have a thick accent, and he has an odd style of teaching where he uses his courseware too much and oddly organized notes on overheads, but simply: if you don't go to class, you'll do terrible.", "Very nice person, modest and accepts critique, knows his stuff (most of the time). On the down side: quite messy, bad lecturing, inconsistent pace (can dwell long on basic stuff and cruise through other chapters). If you are smart you will not have trouble figuring out everything he is trying to say.", "really nice guy and proff", "He knows his stuff. Very knowledgeable which sometimes makes him go faster & students sometimes cant keep pace with that. Lectures are important with bonus marks given for attendance on special occasions like test review. Textbook reading is a must. Practice tests in course ware are a must & very similar to actual tests.", "bad prof, unorganized method of teaching, boring lectures, basically I learned everything from the textbook, and ignored the lecture notes completely, didn't understand what he was saying in class anyways", "Do not go to the class u can understand everything from the textbook and courseware. His lecture has significantly decreased my interest in Economics.", "AHHH STOP USING OVERHEADS. if u take notes in class you will find that they are extremely useless. there are 2 things you need to do. 1) read the covered sections in the textbook. 2) do the practise tests in the courseware. you might also get a thing or two out of looking at the courseware notes.", "Great guy, hard to understand but you will get the point. His quizes and tests are exactly like his previous tests and quizes, so study the courseware, dont bother looking at the study guide.", "Had him for 1b03&2hh3, pretty much the same thing. Everything is in the custom courseware he uses, practice tests/quizzes. He's a pretty bad prof, boring, doesn't explain things well. Uses formulas and graphs without really explaining why we use them. The only good thing is it's a guaranteed A-.. getting an A+ is a BIT harder but still very doable.", "If you have him for first year econ, do all of the study guide questions before every test!!! Many of the same questions come up on his tests. If you use your textbook and attend class you will do very well.", "HE is one of the best prof ever", "his class is the easiest in MAC, just study the study guide and the final guide line, then u will be all fine and get high mark. he give high mark for essays too!", "He is a good prof and seems to care a lot. i love the pace of the class. and enjoyed the class bt stressed the**** outta me in the first test. :s ... very helpful", "the coolest prof at mac", "Easiest A+ you'll get at Mac! Cool Prof...", "Likes to string as much jargon into one sentence as he can.  Very confusing.  Use normal words please.", "constantly late for class, does not teach the material effectively so you better be willing to read the textbook and learn yourself...university needs to seriously evaluate him and demote/replace him...he is a joke and obviously takes teaching the course as a joke...if you enjoy teaching yourself economics, take khan.", "interesting.", "I got an A with him in first year but this man should not be teaching at all. He rambles on about his macro models but the only all he does is write formula after formula, introduce new variables, solving for variables. This is not economics. Even if he didn't have an accent, he would still be very hard to follow. Pretty much a self-study course.", "Great prof. All his lectures are based on the custom courseware (which has old tests/exams). So easy. Take a lot of questions from old tests/exams. Kinda boring class. For the final he actually gives everyone a review sheet which basically tells you the topic to study. AND neatest of all, he buys the entire class pizza near the end of the term!", "Khan is a decent prof. Tries hard to convey the concepts; sometimes he succedes sometimes he doesn't. I think that probably he knows that he is not very good at teaching so this is why he gives easy tests.", "I can't understand his accent. He speaks and speaks, but nothing makes sense. When approched, he isn't that friendly and is very short-tempered. His overhead notes make no sense. I would not recommend this prof.", "amazing prof. he loves students and cares for their well being. unlike other profs who are just in it for the money (hannah holmes)", "Boring,u never know what he is talking about. We don't go to his class because we don't want to waste time. We can passed this course only depending on our self-study.", "You have to get into this class he gives you tonnes of bonus marks and he is very easy. He sucks at lectures but you can learn everything on your own. He is very helpful with the final. I was going in with a 12 no problem.", "I have Prof. Khan ever since 1st year 1A06, now I'm in 3rd.  I pretty much self-learnt over the past 3 years.  I agree he's nice; but this' not doing any good on u, esp. those who wanna proceed into econ.  His tests are not easy, just b/c he copied frm his past papers, we THOUGHT they are easy.  wait and see his finals, they are tough!", "All you first year students haven't experienced the dark side of having him in upper year courses. Absolutely terrible. He is unclear and doesn't even know what he is talking about. Btw, the free pizza is a bribe for boosting his rating.", "very good prof, helpfull, easy, funny, classes are optional as he basically tries to make u understand the concepts, read teh study guide and courseware and you'll ace the course. PIZZZZZZZZAAA MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM", "Midterms are easy but be prepared to get owned in the final.", "You absolutely learn nothing in class. Just do the study guide, past exams and textbook. East midterms but kills you in the final.", "Khan appears to be nice and pleasant in class but email him or talk to him in his office its a different story. Totally rude! Gives you pizza at the end of semester; wants you to give me a higher rating!! You learn absolutely nothing in class, the textbook is your friend. Horrible prof.", "Rashman is the best ever teacher I've ever had. He is so cool!! Very clear speaker, good jokes, good pizza, and excellent teaching philosophy.", "just not a good prof.  and he knows it thats where the pizza party came from thats why he cuts us all those breaks he is trying to cover it up.  But he is still an easy good mark.  Great elective for engineers.", "Very easy, hilarious prof. Course is designed for you to get a good mark. Lectures are helpful but not necessary.", "The man discusses far too often on things off topic, gives you pizza last class to get a better teacher rating. Honestly his tests are retarded &quot;best fit&quot; multiple choice, go to class if you dare!", "He is the coolest prof of all time. Hes my favourite teacher ive ever had. He's so funny and talks about the most random things!! I love how he talks about the leafs every lecture! Khan your the man!!!", "i wont say he's hard.  just if you guys want an easy mark, go with him.  if u intend to do Hon.E. , avoid his classes by all means.  You WILL NOT learn anything from him, it just costed you pains if you procced further in the economics field if you have Khan for the first yr 06 and both 2nd yr intermediate marco. courses. Good Luck", "Economics is very hard", "Excellent Prof!", "Khan is the man, he sets you up to do well.. you guys are morons if you didnt do well.. its your own fault.. learn how to read and maybe you can pass", "The man's a moron, he gives you 5% because he gets 5% of each answer key wrong. He can't even even copy a text book. He jumps around three handwritten transparencies at once erasing and correcting his mistakes, of course you can't understand him b/c of his accent. The man is dazed, confused and lost", "Great Prof! Takes the best 2 out of 3 test, and best 3 out of 4 assignments. Lot of multiple choice questions are from the study guide. Exam is fair, but kinda long (100 MC). Overall, a great prof", "khan is funny... and because of his funny accent.. i doubt most of the class know what he is talking about... but he gives you &quot;sample&quot; exam questions, and takes a lot of quesitons from his study guide... at the end he also gives the whole class a 5% bonus because the average is soo bad.", "All i have to say is STUDY GUIDE. He also takes questions right from his courseware and the tests in there. Apart from his &quot;stories&quot; and his accent he's alright, very helpful. Bad prof, makes up for it with easy tests no doubt. He gives the whole class extra marks lol..Good guy", "This class is so easy if you just read the text and actually attend. He offers his students sooo much help and he's a really nice guy! He brought us pizza but that's just the kind of guy he is, he actually cares about his students and wants them to do well.His tests and assignments are also fair!", "Good prof. Fair exams. You can ace the course if you go to class.", "he's a funny guy", "He is one of the best profs in Mc. Easy test and ass. Easy gong person. nice guy. study with him/", "He is the BEST~ i love him so much ! ~ his class is really easy ~", "hard to understand his accent :(", "Okay class. Used a small chalkboard in a huge class, making it impossible to see. Not a hard class though.", "i dont like this professor", "guys .. stop saying he's easy .. i have him since 1A06 last year and he's getting harder year by year !! the past exam on 2H was the most tricky exam i have received from khan ... and our class avg is dropping ... he's not that easy anymore &gt;.&lt;", "I LOVE HIM!!!!!", "this guy is the man. how many proffs buy pizza for a whole macroeconomics class", "NOBODY DARE SAY NOTHING BAD ABOUT HIM! HE's THE BEST. U DAM FIRST YEARS, I HOPE U FAIL!", "this prof is as bad as it can get. for sure ur not gonna learn anything in his class, besides his personal life and what he watched on TV last night.Not helpful whatsoever..sleeps during his office hrs.self-study the text otherwise 3rd yr will be nightmar", "This is a review from gr.12 economics for me but its ok. He has a funny humour and tries to get us involved but his notes make no sense.", "INCREDIBLE!", "Great prof and also took WHOLE class out for beer and wings!!!!", "Class was boring but a good mark was easy to get as long as you looked over the study guide & old tests he provided. At least 50% of the questions you practice will show up on the test. Nice guy, feel lucky if u get him for 1A06 other profs much harder!", "he is a good prof. care about his student and his test are fair not so hot and everytime he said &quot;it will be on the test&quot; it surely will appear on the test. anyway a good prof.", "Great prof--explains concepts really well....always available for extra help...also, VERY nice- took entire class out for beer, nachos and wings!!!!!!!", "He's an easy prof i guess... even i'm not doing too well in his class.  He can't really explain well dou, but he really hopes ppl can go to his class, he's a nice man beside his lecture r mainly helpless in study for the tests and exams", "Easiest prof ever. Can't understand his lectures at all. Going to class is a complete waste of time. He talks about the Leafs. I'm convinced he purposely makes the course easy so that he'll get good student reviews and keep getting his contract renewed.", "VERY NICE PROF!", "i dun think his tests r easy beside the first one... the rest are hard.  But his lectures are helpless, he talks about useless stuffs during lecture.  Perhaps a full lecutre explaining how to look at the graph&#63;  We have learnt that early in Gr.9", "damn you ppl.

He recycles questions  ALOT!", "dare iv it ive", "hes a good guy...taught me to find the  derivative ...hehe ;)", "It doesn't get any easier than this.  Ask him about the Blue Jays.

The only complain is his homework problems and quizzes are not challenging enough. They are almost like High School difficulty level, or even easier then that. Guaranteed 12 if you take any course(s) taught by Prof Wang.", "I guess this prof doesn't care at all about students. He wants to put trivial questions on assignments and the quiz so that we don't learn the subject. Dear sir, we want extremely extremely difficult questions. We NEED to learn complex analysis. We really want a lot of hard proof questions on the assignments, test and final exam. Thanks.", "I hope the course gets harder. Assignment and quiz have been a breeze.

I look forward to being challenged. Please put some ridiculously challenging proof questions on tests and exams, so that people who are looking forward to enhance their mathematical ability donot feel insulted by easy questions.", "I am very disappointed so far. I took complex analysis to learn advanced mathematics, to stimulate my mind, not to get an easy credit. Professor Wang is turning it into a bird course, meaning I won't even have to attend lecture any more.

He could do some more examples, but his slow pace through the material is much appreciated. 2R03 is challenging. If you don't absolutely need it, don't take it.", "Amazing prof at explaining the course material.  But course material seemed pretty rough for a lot of the students. Pay attention in lectures or else there is totally no point (ie, you cant just get by reading off of the notes he gives)", "Dr. Wang is an awesome prof.  He explains things very well and doesn't rush through material.  Plus his classes flow very nicely, although with 2R, once you are lost in a lecture, there is no coming back.", "Math 2S03 is a very hard course, at least it was when I took it with Prof. Wang.  Don't take this course if you don't need to.. it most probably will bring the GPA down.", "I enjoyed taking calc.  Lots of examples.  Was very friendly in arranging to help me outside of his scheduled office hours.  Real benefit in seeing him for more help.  Good communicator.", "Spent too much time teaching theory and very little showing examples and practicality. Assumed we understoof too much and by the end, no one was going to class.

I wish her longevity and the greatest comfort in the years to come.", "My main complaint is too much time is required for learning how to write kanji which I don't see as that important of a skill to learn given that we can just type on computers, in which case, you only need to know how to read kanji.  She should shift more time to practicing speaking and listening skills.", "Good prof, actually cares about her students. Tests are fair but assignments are not.", "Very willing to explain however she does move fast. She will leave you in the dust with Kanji if you are unfamiliar with it. Ritualistic study is a must for \"non-Kanji\" students. Is more than willing to meet with you during office hours but can appear aloof and a bit intimidating.", "One of my favourite professors! Very helpful inside and outside the classroom, although her tests are quite hard but fair. Mini quizzes helps me a lot in her class", "A little jaded perhaps, but a helpful prof if you're taking upper-year Japanese. Bring back fourth year!", "Not very friendly outside of class. Shows unfair favouritism towards non-Asian students (if you pay attention it's very obvious). Never willing to compromise. Office hours are terrible. As the previous poster mentioned, you will benefit a lot from studying on your own outside of class.", "Other than being a picky marker, she is very aloof outside of class and has mood swings every now and then. A 12 is impossible to achieve unless you are serious about the language and willing to do some self-studying. The oral test is the most difficult aspect of the course and will greatly affect your mark.", "great prof~love her~", "After 4 years with Iwai Sensei, I can say that I speak Japanese better than other University grads.  But it was hard as hell!  The tests are usually right from the text.  The assignments are rather arbitrarily marked.  You get a B if you do what she asks.  I'm not sure how to get an A on them, other than getting a Japanese person to proof-read it!", "The pace of this class was extremely hectic, but made sure that the student stayed on their toes.  This prof is always willing to answer questions, explain and give more examples.", "tough teacher but worth it :P", "good teacher", "always prepared and willing to answer questions.  test #1 will kill you.  if you survive it, you will ace test #2.  treats her students equally and really loves teaching.", "Great prof! Once you pass you first surprise by the fact that to study foreign language you actually have to work, you'll enjoy every minute of class.", "Too much for us in this beginner course compare with another pro.", "she's awesome!Very hard tests, but always willing to help and totemo kawaiidesu!", "Iwai-sensei is AMAZING.  Extremely helpful both in and outside of the class", "not ease (after all this is language we're learning here), but fair.", "Terrible English speaker! u can never understand her in both Eng &

Thank you Dr. deCat!", "I really enjoyed both classes (4Y03 is pretty much a continuation of 3M03), the textbook he wrote was very good and you can just read that instead of going to class, if you can find his previous tests, almost every question will be from there, with some work you can easily get an A", "He is a wonderful professor! If you are interested in pursing neuroscience and want to explore it on a deeper level this is the course for you. Dr. Decatanzaro is engaging, helpful and above all simulates a very comfortable learning environment. One of the best psychology professors I've ever had!", "Such a powerful yet gentle/kind man! Obvious ultra-genius. Lectures are intense and captivating, course is carefuly designed and coherent. 2 mid-terms, 1 in class assignment. One of the most worth-while courses I've taken.", "The course involves absolutely empirical evidences and was very interesting!! Recommended to students with some anatomy background who especially likes to digest many pieces of facts.", "the tests are difficult if you don`t study but if you keep up with the material you`ll be fine. He does use short answers but his tests are very fair; they are challenging, but that`s how they should be. as deCat would probably agree, psych majors without a scientific mind should not take this course.", "he is really boring!!...the notes he uses are not complete meaning you have to go to class (or read his book, which is also boring). his tests have an unusual format, and are really hard to do well on. i don't feel like i've learned a lot of new stuff in this class either.", "Needed to stay on top of things and study hard to do well, but good course for sure.", "great course!", "Great class!", "All I can say is that this class and this prof are both VERY VERY BORING. Save yourself the agony and depression, DONOT take his course. His tests have nasty short answer essays as well. Avoid him or else you gonn regret it.", "This class was great! He is enthusiastic about motivation and emotion. Hated the first day but the trick is to sit near the front because he is (unintentionally) hilarious. He looks a bit like Will Farrel imitating a teacher, he stands with his hand resting in the back of his pants and his catch phrase was &quot;Basic emotions&quot;\r Tests were COMPREHENSIVE", "Nice guy, cool lectures! I took one of his courses a couple of years ago and wanted to take another...unfortunately he wasn't teaching last year.", "I found him to be the most useless and worthless professor in the entire psychology department.

I think of his Psych 3M03 course as pure garbage which is useless and SOOOOOOO BOOOOAAARRINNGG", "Great prof! I really enjoyed his course :)", "He is a terrible prof. He mumbles and his textbook is so complicated and made my head pain. I dont recommend him to anybody!!!", "This guy really sucks, he is SOOOOOOOOOOOOoo boring...and his tests are hard, but if you have a lot of old tests, he repeats some questions. The short answer questions are terrible, and his class will make you fall asleep. I don't recommend this prof to anyone. His textbook is so boring to read as well. I had to cancel his course many years back", "This prof thinks psych is some hot shot neuroscience discipline LOLLLL that's jokess man. I found it funny the way he said on the first day some students were trying to get into his class, there will be absolutely no prerequisite waivers. OMG this is the most boring psych course ever. NEVER take it, he lectures SOO boring. He re-uses test questions", "Great prof, good lectures, although the short paper was pretty pointless and marked hard. Tests were fair, hard if you don't study. Lectures correlate with the text pretty well (probably since he wrote it.)", "I really liked Dr. Decatanzaro even though many found him a tad boring in 3M03. I really enjoyed the course and since taking it have found that the material applies to many other courses that I've taken. I would recommend the prof and the course! His midterms were very fair and his exam esp his MC were tricky but overall great course!", "Awesome prof...probably one of the best MAC has to offer. Fair tests and great attitude!", "He is one of the best psychology professors at McMaster and his course is interesting.", "Awesome prof!!! He get's so excited when students ask questions and he's always eager to answer them. I can tell he loves teaching, and he loves the material - the sign of a truely great teacher. He goes out of his way for us. Thanks!", "So kind, cares a great deal about subject matter and about students.  Tests are fair as long as you study.", "Dr. DeCatanzaro is a great guy with so much to teach.  He teaches in a way that helps you really learn the material and he tests major concepts.", "Great prof, fair class, good texts.  Bonus essay is great idea. take this course.", "He is a nice and fair prof. Take his course.", "great prof, very smart man, godo sense of humour and down to earth.  Tests are challenging but fair. This guy makes you want to go to class, even if its at 5:30pm in T-28!", "Dr. Decatanzaro is one of McMaster's best. He is helful, knowledgable, compassionate, caring and interesting. Marking is completely fair, rewarding and methodical. His text is the best book I bought in my undergrad. ed. You will love this course for sure!", "The BEST prof I have ever had!

Exceptional and clever sense of humour, and an all-around great man.  :)", "Such a chill prof.  Lectures to a small class with a cup of coffee in his hand.  Lectures are more like conversations.

I would take any course with him!", "He keeps class very interactive and interesting by using current disease and conditions in his examples as well as utilizing the TAs to demonstrate specific activities. He likes to perform \"role plays\" of various conditions during class. A downside is that his tests are too short and there are very few chances to redeem   your mark in the course.", "Very difficult to understand, since he speaks very fast. His email explanations are very unclear. He is very approachable after class. His tests are too short", "I've taken two classes with Ullal, decided to minor in Psych so I can take more with him! Such a sweet, easygoing guy, and he's so passionate about teaching. His 2NF3 class is especially interesting, definitely recommended", "His short answers were marked way too hard. Other than that, the material is interesting and he can communicate it well in lecture. The only thing is that his e-mails tend to be extremely useless if you are trying to understand something.", "He is extremely knowledgeable and very approachable after class. The course was really well structured and the content was very interesting. He paces himself according to the class, teaching whatever he can without stressing over time. Defined my interest in clinical neuroscience.", "He is very enthusiastic about his material, however he is very hard to understand sometimes - he tend to talk in a very low voice, thick accent, and fast.  If you're going to take a class of his do yourself a favour and sit in a front row.", "Designed my career for me. Never had a prof that has had such a profound effect on me. Thank you Prof. Ullal.", "His exams will ruin you, you will be lucky to get a C, no tutorials, sometimes one assignment per course, (ive taken more than one of his courses), overall, very difficult.", "he does love what he teaches but his tests are ridiculous, and i mean you can study A LOT for them and still get horrible because he tests on the most irrelevant details that have nothing to do with what the main focus of the lectures are about. And this has nothing to do with being whiny, his tests are just plain unfair period.", "Dr. Ullal is great prof. Has so much passion for what he does. As long as you understand the slides and you go to every lecture it's not impossible to get an A. He can be quite specific when he's testing you with details, but it's not the hardest course.", "Really awesome prof. Makes the subject interesting. Hard tests and exams.", "Great teacher. enough said.", "This guy is brutal, hes nice and enthusiastic and all but hes doesnt speak loud enough, hes boring as hell and hard to understand. He likes to test the most random things out of his lectures. I don't recommend this one.", "A very poor professor. Shouldn't still be teaching. Lectures are all over the place and he can be difficult to understand due to his accent.He also tends to test on the most specific, irrelevant details resulting in test averages in the 50s. Low competence in using online resources.", "Interesting class. Memorize like crazy. Not insurmountable, but hard to get 12. Dr. Ullal, however, is a fantastic professor who shows enthusiasm and interest in teaching. Tests and assignments depend on how nice the TAs are, and they are variable. Only about 5-10 people will get 12s each semester but getting 10 or over is possible with studying.", "Dr. Ullal is one of my favourite professors ever.He made neuroscience and sensory processes classes so interesting and educative.I got A in both of them and I decided to focus on neuroscience in the future.he is very enthusiastic and nice.But I do admit,you have to study your *ss off to get good marks.", "You will rock this course if you memorize the lectures, which is easier said than done as they tend to be ALL OVER THE PLACE! Don't need to read the text because he never tests out of it. Over all, if you're interested in the content, take 2F03 instead, which covers the same content but is structured much more logically.", "A disappointment of a professor; he ruined my interest in Visual Neuroscience and Neuroscience altogether. Tests are tough and not very fair. I am not taking any more Neuroscience courses after this. I want to thank him for ruining my interest.", "Good man, has passion for what he teaches. A solid criticism is that he tests extremely specific details, often things mentioned in passing during the lecture. Go to every lecture and memorize everything on the slides and that he talks about.", "Dr. Ullal loves what he teaches and is always open to questions - very helpful during office hours too. Although his tests may be very specific at times it is by no means impossible to get an A - but you do need to go to lecture as some slides are vague. This is the second time i have had him as a prof and i dont regret it!", "This guy is pretty awful.  Simply for the fact that his tests are made up of the most minute little insignificant details that we've learned, rather than covering the bigger concepts we've focused on.  Never taking one of his courses again.", "Drop the course if you see ULAL name on there", "He has no mercy on students. He teaches useless courses that won't get students anywhere career wise but gives brutal exams. He speaks with an indian accent and lot of times stuff he talks is hard to decipher. You must have done something very wrong in your previous life to have ullal as your professor in this life -- it is a curse to have mr.ullal", "There are rumours going around that Dr. Ullal writes his own good reviews on this site.", "Everyone who has said bad things about this prof are people who didnt study and go to lecture. His classes are brutal. You have to study your butt off but in the end it pays off. I still remember everything I learned in those classes. People should spend more time studying than whining its not what your paying for.", "This professor cannot handle constructive criticism. Period. you see all these comments under review below&#63; This shows what Mr. Ullal's personality is like.", "I had him for Sensory Processes last yr. I found his class to be boring and his exams to be unfair. He would focus on tiny details sometimes that you did not expect. I wanted to take Neuropsychology this year but when I found out that Mr. Ullal is teaching the course, I decided not to take it. I was very disapointed. Dont ruin your term. Avoid him", "Dr. Ullal is the worst professor in the entire history of psychology professors. I want to thank him for being such a horrible prof with no emotions or mercy on students. His students grades or success doesn't matter to him. The only thing he is worried about is that the lousy psych department should not frown at him, so he doesn't lose his Job", "Dr. Ullal is a very intelligent man who expects that his students bring a passion and keen interest towards course material. As long as one puts forth an effort towards studying and attending lectures a high grade can be achieved. Do not leave studying until the night before or concepts will be overwehlming. Questions are always encouraged.", "The best prof I have ever had in McMaster. He really teaches you and makes sure you learn it at the end of the day. Just memorize his slides and ur fine! No text book or anything.", "MEMORIZE his slides. He tests you on small details, and he may ask you short answers about topics he has never discussed. A main concept or focus area doesnt mean its important. Howevr, it did well in the 2 classes I took with him. If you read the slides over and over you should be able to get a good grade !", "The course itself is interesting, but his tests and exams are VERY hard.  You need to know absolutely every single little detail because you never know what to expect from him.  His questions are very random and all over the place.", "I do agree completely with the rater below. Ullal IS helpful in the sense that he responds to emails always, he is always happy to meet with you outside of class if you need help. But it's all an act. Professors should not be taken at face value. His tests are very unfair. The easy MCQ are worth very little. The hard SA are worth a lot. Mean prof.", "I took the course second term in 2009. I worked for my 12 and the course is 12able if you study and memorize some random number. Dr. Ullal is very helpful if you ask him for additional clarification either through email or in person.", "The best prof one could ever ask for. He is truly passionate about what he teaches and has been the source of inspiration for everything I've achieved ever since I took his class. It's definitely not a bird course and I don't think Neuroscience is ever meant to be. Think about that before you sign up for his course and you'll enjoy it.", "Worst Psych. Prof. EvERR.R.R.R.", "Worst Psychology Professor you can ever get. Speaks with a THICK INDIAN ACCENT and is very hard to decipher what he's talking. He is more concerned about saving his job then the welfare of his students. If many people get poor marks in 2nd year nuisance psych courses, it is fine with him. What a terrible professor. I suppose he has no heart.", "Truly loves what he is doing, extremely passionate about the topic. He is always so happy! Make sure you go to lecture and you don't buy the textbook.", "Great professor. Always willing to help students. Material is tough (but it is a neuroscience course). He does a great job in teaching the basics. Maybe a little too much detail and specifics of studies. Tests are tough, need to know all the little details.", "TOUGHEST PSYCHOLOGY Professor in the history of this planet. He comes up with all kinds of cheap tricks to make sure students do poorly in his courses. He started asking short answer questions since the past couple years to ensure a low class average. He says he wants students to learn. YEAH SURE. All I can tell you is *GOOD LUCK* if you have him.", "Dr. Ullal is a very interesting prof who obviously loves what he teaches. Warning: His tests are extremely biased as to what he enjoys (clinical disorders) and not representative of overall course. He does not use the text book, don't bother buying it.", "PLEASE MAKE THE EXAMS EASY", "Sensorry processes is so boring. He is the worst prof ever. I hate his accent. He smiles a lot, but he will make you sad after his exams", "Very nice and polite in talking with students, but the professor is very &quot;hard&quot; when it comes to tests and exams.", "I think he is a good prof. Gets excited about what he is teaching. His tests ARE hard (at least for me). Hes very willing to help and doesnt care how much material he covers as long as you understand. He loves discussion in class and would rather that than rush thru planned material", "I now work at the Salvation Army thanks to this prof and my wonderful Psych degree. Thank you so much Ullalalalalalala.", "Short Answers are very mean and designed to bring down the class average. He teaches the most worthless program in the planet - P S Y C HOLOGY !!! It will get you a job as bartender if you got a degree in Psychology. I graduated with distinction in Psych, and I work in a bank as a teller. I could get that job with my High School diploma itself", "This Indian man looks like a monkey from the face. He will seriously make you sad if you take his awful courses. He has no life that's why he teaches 2nd Year Psych HAHAHA even after having an MD, PHD. I guess nobody in Canada would employ him that's why he is still an Assistant Professor. His exams are designed to make sure you fail. His Short Ans", "Course is interesting and Ullal is definitely a good prof - very passionate about what he's teaching and eager to help. He does have a heavy accent which can make him difficult to understand sometimes but  follow his lecture notes and you should be fine. Tests were fair - everything comes straight out of the lecture notes so be sure to study those!", "Boring Professor.", "If I were to rate this prof, I will give him less then 1 out of 5. Negative marks are more appropriate for him. He has an annoying voice and the success of his students disturbs him, which explains why he sets unreasonably hard tests. I suppose McMaster will frown at him, if the class average is too high. Miserable professor. Thumbs down for Ullalu", "teacher is nice and approachable but tests are very detailed, he asks questions on slides that he simply skimmed though during lectures and barely ask question on the slides he wasted half the lecture on. his short answers are quite challenging. lectures are also random. but his assignments are easy.overall, READ EVERYTHING in his lecture notes!!", "Worst damn professor I have ever had the misfortune of meeting. He is terrible at teaching, speaks english with a very heavy indian accent, and is overall hard to follow during lectures. His lecturing is scattered and all over the place, plus he makes the tests very difficult with his terrible short answer questions. He wants students to do poorly.", "it's the second class of his that I took and again he's really a great prof and made neuropsych an interesting class to attend, juz wish the accent is not as heavy....but despite that, great prof, great class, recommend it", "He is so boring! I find it hard to focus in his lectures because of how boring he is.", "terrible prof. speaks with a heavy indian accent and is hard to follow during lectures. tests are very difficult.", "He is very eager and willing to help. I find it sad when people feel the need to berate a professor because they don't put forth an effort and expect easy marks. His tests are definitely fair. It is also ironic when the harshest critics cannot use the English language themselves in written form. Perhaps that is why they can't handle short answers&#63;", "He LOVES SHORRRTTT AAANSSWEEER questions", "Awesome prof, i love him. Very friendly and eager to help. Gets very excited about the retina!", "easy course because he makes his expectations crystal clear. Great prof, although with accent, definitely passionate abt the course material.", "He used to be one of the best professors many years ago and people used to take his class to raise their GPA. But NOW he has become one of the toughest profs in Psych so STAY AWAY from any course taught by Gautam Ramesh Ullal. He keeps getting tougher every term. Now he gives &quot;SHORT ANSWER&quot; questions on TESTS AND FINAL EXAM. HOw horrible is that!!", "Gautam Ramesh Ullal IS the toughest professor of McMaster Psychology", "Dr. Ullal should STOP GIVING SHORT ANSWER QUESTIONS ON MIDTERMS. EVERYONE HATES SHORT ANSWERS THAT'S WHY SO MANY STUDENTS SKIPPED THE TESTS. He also needs to put more questions on the final exam. 60 questions is too less. He is trying to keep the class average low that's why he is using this tactic. Get over it sir, Psychology is garbage program.", "Apparently he is a medical doctor but he teaches garbage PSYCH courses that too 2nd year. He should be teaching meds school, not a useless program like psychology. He is so hard on students, his short answer questions are insane, that's why so many students miss his tests and bring medical note so that he puts the weight to the final which is MCQ", "Good Professor. Asks everything from the lecture slides. Assignments are very easy. Tests are tough because the short answers are nasty. Final is much easier because it is entirely multiple choice and if you studied you will do very well. Use Judgement here.. Hint Hint...", "Definately one of the easier psych courses at Mac..highly recommend taking it. There are 2 assignments..but worth it. His sense of humor makes the course fly by! Very approachable..and open to questions..slows down for the class if you have any questions or need anything clarified..the topics delt with in class are applicable to everday settings.", "Ullal is an awesome teacher and very funny at times as well. I thought that his lectures were very helpful and I never found myself nodding off. However, it may take a couple classes before you get used to his accent.", "1st: For people that say psychology is not a science should best consider dropping out of university because it is a science in everyway. Dr. Ullal has always been the most passionate and best prof at McMaster so any bad comments evidently just reflect that they got a bad mark. HA sore losers. I would always recommend his course. THE BEST :)", "One of the best professors I've ever had.  He really made a difference in my life goals.", "He was horrible! I couldn't understand a thing he said! His accent was soo thick and he spoke too fast! I would never take a class with him again", "VERY VERY Hard professor. He thinks psychology is a science. The easiest multiple choice are worth very little and his nasty so called SHORT answer are worth most marks. YUCK!!!! I hate short answer questions!!!!!!! Avoid his courses. You can't get NOWHERE in life with a useless psychology degree. Maybe work in macdonald's if you are lucky.", "bad prof. brutal tests and exams. makes the relatively easy MC questions worth 0.5 marks and the tough ass SA question worth like 4-5 marks. if u mess up SA, ur done. gets mad at students randomly.", "Fun professor, some find him hard to understand due to accent, I got used to it quickly though. Kept classes interesting, even the boring stuff, fun slide shows, humorous.", "Makes learning about psychology fun!", "Nice person, HARD prof. Brutal exams. SOooo few questions.. NOT Fair. Needs to take it easy on students. Psychology is only an 'Arts' discipline, it is not a science. Or maybe it's a soft-core science, not 'real' science.", "explains concepts using confusing diagrams created in Paint; has trouble with sharing information in any other way.", "Good prof..lectures are good, but his tests are SOO hard, when I took him for Psych 2E03, he would give like 25 questions on a test and it's worth 30% of the final mark&#63; That's ridiculous :( He gives few questions on tests because then you have less chance to screw up and the class average would not be high. I heard he gave easy tests earlier days!", "good course... but i swear he totally freaked out on us many times... complete melt down he got mad at some students and started yelling at all of us and threatening not to teach certain topics and put them on the test... it was REALLY strange..", "He cares. If you study and come to class, you'll do fine!", "Dr Gautam Ullal is a great professor at McMaster University. His way of explanation is very clear and he tends to explain from Basics. He is a hilalrious professor and has a very good sense of humour :) thats why he is so popular!!", "He is the best professor at McMaster University", "It is very difficult to understand what this prof is saying due to his accent.  Marked presentations very hard.", "Good prof. Before he was easy, but now he has become much more tough. He gives fewer questions on exams now then what I heard he used to some years back, so less chance to screw up.", "He wanted you to learn. His lectures were very unorderly. You never really understood in a &quot;smooth&quot; way..Everything was scattered. He wasnt very responsive via emails and had no office hours. He was highly  motivated as a prof though.", "He's a good prof, dont get me wrong. Absolutely amazing, compationate, knowledgable - the works. He even wrote us a poem at the end and it was very cute. But the course overall was very hard. THE EXAM WAS TOTALLY RANDOM! Completely Random.", "He's a good prof", "He is the best prof. at Mac. That makes it all!", "Dr. Ullal is the most amazing, enthusiastic and intelligent professor(He's a medical doctor). He is the only prof I have had who actually feels a concern and his responsibility for the performance of his students. He presents information that you need to know, and reading the text is not even required since all exams are based strictly on lectures", "AMAZIN PROf. Best prof I have seen at McMaster University. Always smiling, has a good teaching attitude, quiet funny, absolutely puts helping students first and will repeat as many times till you get it. If you plan to take any Neuroscience related course (2F03, 2E03, 3J03) I STRONGLY recommend you take ONLY WITH HIM. Tests are most fair - ONLY MCQ", "He is decent, I would only suggest teaching with better flow and explaining the information a little better seing as some of the stuff is new to us.", "Please put more questions on tests. 25 multiple choice is too less for an exam worth 30% of the final grade", "He was fairly easy for PSYCH2F03 but tougher for 3J03. He's a nice person, and his exams are actually fair, but the courses he teaches are difficult.", "An amazing prof. And those that say hes hard to understand and can't speak english (in which case I dont see how his research in known world-wide) ... its called try perfecting the pronounciation of a language at the age of 24 ... Hes fineee people ... lay off", "I LOVE DR. ULLAL!!!!!! Hes so funny and sweet, and makes the class so interesting.  But his tests are hard but hes always there to help you.", "I think Dr. Ullal is such a genuine professor. YOu can tell he really wants the student to learn and he is so good at what he does. THe tests are hard, however if you go to every class and STUDY, you should be fine.", "His Tests are killer. Better watch out if you take that course with him.", "2F03 was easy, but 3J03 was HARD! He is such a nice prof, always wanting students to understand rather than rushing material. Great class, but be prepared to work VERY hard.", "Way too hard", "He's a nice man and all, but his tests are brutal this semester. Very very hard professor", "If you want a better prof than Ullal you simply aren't going to find it. Loves his work, speaks japanese, sings and acts. Neuroscience never got better", "Dr. Ullal is the ***BEST*** professor at McMaster University. He loves to teach and really cares about the success of his students. He looks so cute when he smiles, and he's quiet entertaining. I hate all night classes but he makes the Wednesday night lecture a pleasure to attend. Other profs should learn to be as honest and dedicated as him.", "Dr Ullal is a really sweet person and an awesome prof.  He is the only prof who actually cares about the students.  He is also really intelligent and knows everything!  His tests are hard, so dont be fooled by his niceness, but if you attend all lectures, and take good notes, you'll do fine.  Overall, excellent professor!", "A good guy, but his exams are hard. Questions are worded tricky and there are many questions which are worded in a different way from his lecture notes.", "The most amazing professor I've ever had at Mac. He's pleasent, rediculously intelligent, and funny. anyone who could make behavourial Neuroscience a fair course is amazing.", "taken all of his classes, loved them all.  must say, he defined my career path for me.  best prof ever!  very helpful, very patient, and very funny.  never a boring moment.  is sincerely interested in his students which is hard to come across.", "Great PROF!!!", "Such a great class. His teaching style is easy to follow and his &quot;real-life&quot; examples are hilarious! He also sings, which is an added bonus!", "By far one of my favorite psych classes so far. Dr. Ulall is definitely one of the best profs at MAC. He is SUPER willing to help students and is always willing to reexplain things until everyone understands. He also tries to make the lecture fun and just does a fantastic job.", "Dr. Ullal is absolutely ADORABLE!! Now that he uses powerpoint, his lectures are easy to follow and understand...he makes a tough course enjoyable! I think he's just the cutest thing ever!", "The course is hard and will require a lot of reading, but if ur prepared to do that u will enjoy it and learn a lot.  dr ullal knows a lot and makes sure every1 understands what hes teaching.  i also agree with the earlier comments about his enthusiasm.  his jokes are funny too.", "No Comments", "Neuroscience was by far one of the most interesting classes i've had in my 3.5 years at uni.  Dr. Ullal's enthusiasm is highly contageous, and it made the 3 hour class totally worth the time.  I'm really looking forward to a lot more classes taught by him.", "wow...what a funny guy!! If you want to take a fun and interesting course, this is the ONE!!  Dr. Ullal has so much passion to what he teaches and he's very helpful & a good singer too :) His tests are really fair. He makes neurscience fun. I recommend everyone to take this class.", "Such a funny prof who is passionate about neuroscience.  His tests are fair...straight from his notes.  Remember to take good notes b/c he only posts overheads (which are mainly images).", "good guy", "Final exam was tough", "He's is the nicest man and its very evident that he's interested and excited about neuroscience, which in my opinion, helps the students to also become interested in the course. I would recommend the course to anyone, as long as you have an interest in psychology!! It's straightforward and fun!", "Tough!", "although i agree that he's a nice guy, his overheads are terribly unclear and he does not post all of them online, and/or he will post some that he doesnt even utilize. he is also unhelpful when trying to study for exams and NO review sessions were offered with the TA's prior to exams.", "very good prof, but the second midterm was a bit hard.", "No Comments", "the 2f3 song made my day!  best prof at mac", "wonderful prof.  has lots of knowledge.", "The sweetest guy in town!", "All around excellent professor. Amazing course. Take the course if he's teaching.", "best professor at mcmaster!!!!", "At first was kinda hard to understand, but after that it was all gravy.  Very approachable, and answered all my questions.", "He is great as a teacher!!", "Hard course, good prof, nice guy", "Great teacher...very helpful", "He is so cute!  He was a little difficult to understand at the beginning, but it got easier.  As long as you take very good notes, you will do fine.  He is also very approachable and encourages questions in class.  Great experience", "Exteremly friendly and approachable. puts his students first. if you don't understand anything he will help you and make you understand. makes the class very very interesting and uses a lot of examples to teach stuff which helps a ton!", "Excellent prof", "he's awesome. he really knows the material and he teaches it well, and he's willing to help if you don't understand.", "He's a good prof", "Maaan, this guy knows his *ish!

Unfortunately the mic did not work very well and if you were sitting further than the first 5 rows, you could barely hear her quiet voice. On the exam, she misprinted a number needed for a calculation, yet didn't tell everyone, only the ones that asked. Her questions are usually rather tricky, mostly fair.", "Really interesting material, but it was hard to pay attention in class due to the fact that she doesn't control audience noise very well. Most test questions were fair, some where out of blue, which also happened in Genetics. She's a very nice lady and usually responds to e-mails.", "Very nice lady that explained concepts okay... but the course was so, so, so disorganized it was ridiculous. Course readings and tutorial answers put up late, readings didn't match up, slides uploaded 5 minutes before class started... learning ended up being a lot harder than it should have been.", "great at explaining concepts and this actually made it easy to pay attention in lectures, even on sleepy days", "Best biology professor I've had so far in university. Her lecture slides are very detailed and helpful. An outstanding lecturer who you can tell loves what she does. Tests and exam are challenging, yet fair with relatively high averages.", "She explains stuff very thoroughly, and gives students some break. Very understanding prof who is willing to cooperate with students. She raised my interest in virology. First test might be confusing, but doable if you study.", "She was great. Went over everything very thoroughly and a lot of clarity. The only issue was that we got our marks late but I think that was only because she teaches many courses each term so it gets hectic for her! but good prof overall.", "Didn't get marks back on time and a course was a bit unorganized. But overall good experience and good prof", "BEST PROF EVARRR!!! sooo nicee and sweettt, avg for tests are fairly high cuz everyone pays attention in class and it doesnt trick you in any way...study hard and there will be a sure 12! she is amazing btw :P", "amazing, very very very very very nice. tests are really easy.", "genuinely nice and smart and wants to see her students succeed without having to babysit them. best prof i've ever had in my life!! her tests were good and she was just plain WONDERFUL! dont worry about the tests, having her as a prof is the greatest joy! :D", "Kim Dej is fantastic! I'm used to having profs who don't care about teaching or are impossible to understand. Dr. Dej was the exact opposite. You can tell she loves teaching and she's really good at it. The course takes a lot of work, but you'll learn tons if you put in the time.", "BEST PROF EVER, HANDS DOWN!!! she is the greatest, the nicest, the most amazing person to have as a prof...winner of the prof of the year award 3 times!", "Had her for cell bio & genetics as well. Best prof @ mac. She's amazing! You'll lover", "I had her for cell bio and genetics and she's by far the best in the bio department and one of the best profs at mac!", "Incredible prof! enjoyed the entire 2 classes i had with her and would love to have her in the future.", "Loved this prof. She cares about the students and is very approachable. The subject wasn't interesting to me originally but she kept me coming to class and raised my excitement about the course. I found her explanations always crystal clear. One of my favourite profs at Mac.", "She's a wonderful prof to have! Loved cell bio only cause she taught it with excellence. She is extremely approachable and really listens to you. Uses great animation videos during class to help visualize certain things. Very fair questions on the midterms and final! Overall she is EXCELLENT!", "Very understanding prof. Don't miss lecture, because she does tend to say more than what's on the slides. Tests are very fair, but the use of CPR fails really hard IMHO.", "I love Dej, she's quirky in a cute way and I like how she likes to hear what students have to say for certain things (getting your voice heard is important).  Overall, my favourite prof at McMaster so far!", "She is by far one of the most genuine profs I've had up to date. She truly does care about her students and her willingness to answer questions and explain concepts is remarkable to see. She is very enthusiastic in what she does and her teaching skills are impressive. Tests are extremely fair as long as you put in sufficient amount of studying.", "Sweetheart of a teacher. Very fair tests ... actually could be a bit harder! I thought I would be doomed after bio 1a03 but was pleasantly surprised.", "SHE MAKES YOU DO TONS OF RESEARCH ON RESEARCH ARTICLES... VERY STRESSING. but a good professor", "Kim Dej is fantastic. She knows how to interact with students- even if some of the subject matter is dry. \r \r Cell and Genetics with her was great. She made sure that students understood the material and genuinely wanted us to do well.\r \r Thanks Kim Dej.", "Great prof - has a teaching [not research] position at Mac and it shows.  Always willing to help - her office hours are useful for clarification and context and details that don't make it into lecture but make the material more interesting.  Tests are fairly easy and she gives you a good idea what's on them... a lot of memorization though", "she is very nice,approchable and cute. she saved me the time of reading my textbook for cell bio(my txt was a waste of my money). but you will still need the textbook for genetics due to the difficult level of the course. but she gives hints on what she will be testing on. so tests were fair and practice tests were extremly helpful!!!overall, GREAT", "Great at explaining concepts, even though the material is rather convoluted with proteins. Always willing to help and clarify for students. Great prof!!", "She's cool and cute", "she is a very good prof:)", "Dr. Dej is fantastic!!! She is extremely caring and will really go out of her way to make sure you understand. Very approachable. She does a great job of making some of the material that can be quite tedious interesting! Would take a course that I didn't like just to have her as a prof!", "Extremely DULLLLLLLLL. But she's a nice prof.", "Kim is so awesome that I would marry her if I had the chance (not even kidding a little bit)", "She's a great prof. Extremely nice and approachable, and her lecture notes contain most of what you need for the course. She's also really good about letting you know what types of questions will be asked on tests/exam.", "she could use more enthusiasm, its extremely hard to stay awake in that class.", "Very approachable.  She's always willing to help her students to understand.  Her tests are fair.", "She teaches far too fast, but other than that she was ok", "she is a nice lady, but BORING.  her lecture notes are EXACTLY the textbook copied on to powerpoint.  attending class just saves you reading over the book.  if she used new examples the class would be much better, but her lectures do cover what you need to do well.", "I actually found her lectures very useful and saved me a lot of time teaching myself things from the text.  I found the midterm and exam to be very fair, and she gave us a lot of tips in class that helped cut a lot of studying time.  Dr. Dej always tried to ensure fairness in everything, and is really great one on one if you ever have any Q's.", "Sweet lady, but BORING! I learned everything I know from the textbook.  Her lectures were pointless as she chose to focus on the easier aspects and skim over the harder, tougher to explain parts.  I only found her lectures useful as a guide for what to focus on in the text and what not to.", "She's very nice and her tests are ok. Now if only she could move past reciting textbook word for word via Powerpoint, we'd be making progress.", "I don't think I've stayed awake for a full class the entire semester.  The overhead slides are straight from the text, and often have had errors. Very little enthusiasm when teaching.", "Copying the textbook into powerpoint slides and reading it word by word in a tedious tone is not exactly what I call teaching!", "I had the hardest time staying awake at her lectures, so I stopped attending lectures after one month. Interestingly, I didn't have any problems in the tests, by just reading the book!", "Soooooooo repetitive, dwells on the same stuff over and over again and only focuses on the simple aspects of the text. She's nice, but I'd rather read the text.", "Has very nicely made slides but sometimes she seems to care more about how the slides look instead of what it says on them. Leaves a lot out from the text and very repetitive but still a nice prof who's willing to answer any questions", "She is a great instructor, has great notes and writes fair tests and tries to answer any questions you have. Awesome professor!", "She is very approachable if you need help; very good for the first time teaching.  nice lady", "She is okay, she tries real hard to make everyone happy. Very helpful, made notes on important stuff from each chapter she taught to help study for test and exam.", "Great effort for first time teaching.  Cares about her students and is good at explaining material.", "Good prof..tries her best however lacks experience and therefore confidence. Very caring towards students. Overall good.", "very nice prof, but needs a big dose of confidence and a lot more enthousiasm to keep the class engaged. repetitive in her notes, but tests fairly and really cares about her students. All Dr. Dej needs is more experience with lecturing, and along with that will come confidence.", "Excellent professor! Clear, thorough and consise!

As a 4.0 student, I find his material very frustrating because he is inaccurate and always contradicts himself.", "To our utmost dismay, this incompetent prof has recently moved to UWO to plague us with his insanely limited understanding of his own field. This lazy person does not spare the time to make his own lecture slides, and instead takes them from a past prof who obviously understood the field better. He then tests material never even mentioned in class.", "Very nice prof. Very helpful. Best class ever !!", "Dr. Junop is the best professor I've ever had! He wants to make sure that his students retain the essentials of the course long after they finish the course. He uses a mix of slides and writing to explain the concepts and really tailors the teaching to the students and the amount of understanding.", "Wonderful teacher! Very kind, approachable, and accommodating. Truly wants you to succeed and emphasizes learning that will actually be relevant, not details that you forget as soon as you write the test. One of my favourite professors!", "He's honestly the nicest and most helpful instructor. His passion for proteins and student learning is quite evident.", "Dr. Junop was the best biochem prof I have ever had. His interest in protein folding and structure determination shines through in his lectures. By punctuating his lessons with practical observations of the field, he brings a personal touch that you just can't get from a textbook. He will be sorely missed here at McMaster.", "Murray was a great supervisor for my 4th year thesis. I could not have asked for a better mentor and teacher. His constant encouragement and guidance throughout my whole thesis allowed me to grow as a researcher and an individual.", "Dr. Junop is definitely one of the best professors in the Biochemistry department. For me, he has been one of the most influential, as it is his passion for structural biology and teaching that inspired me to pursue scientific research as a career.", "Dr. Murray Junop is the most dedicated and compassionate professor I've had in 4 years at McMaster. As he is a top expert in his field, it's a great privilege that he makes so much time for students. Dr. Junop always has his students' best interest in mind and easily draws interest to his area of study, and to the field of biochemistry in general.", "Dr. Junop is one of the nicest prof ever. He cares about his students and is more interested in their learning rather than testing them with time restraints. Very genuine and funny guy.", "BEST PROF EVERRR!!!", "THE BEST BIOCHEM PROF ever.   He is extremely brilliant and cares about his student. The course is designed in really good way.", "Dr. Junop is a fantastic prof.  Very interested in his subject area and eager to pass along his enthusiasm to students.  I wish all my profs were as good!", "I was looking so forward to his class, but once you hear him talk and his boring, slow teaching style, it all falls flat. If you try to go to him for help,he's sarcastic and has an all-knowing attitude. After having amazing biochem profs before, he made me hate biochem and never want to see it again. Horrible prof overall, and very boring/tedious", "Best Prof every! Makes an effort to relate theory to practice and keep classes interesting.  This has been my favorite course so far at McMaster.  Dr. Junop is a gentleman and is a truly gifted educator.", "very good, nice guy, very concerned about his students", "The best teacher I've ever had. He opened up the whole field to me and made pursuing biochemistry as an occupation seem approachable... what a great guy. He's known for taking chances on kids.", "Dr. junop genuinely cares about his students and his teaching. He's class is designed to teach you the concepts you need to follow through with biochemistry instead of memorizing useless facts, which is very valuable. But most of all, you should take his class for all the life lessons he'll teach you. That will stick with you for life.", "He is one the best Prof in biochem department. I had a chance to work with him and he is awesome. I loves his work and loves to talk about it with students. He takes great interest in undergrad courses and help you a lot along the way. he course was a lot of fun. No exam!!!!!. sometime we had open class quiz. i love him as a prof and as a person.", "AMAZING PROF!!! Murray is the reason as to why I am specializing in Biochemistry. In my four years as an undergraduate student, I have never met a prof. as nice and humble as him. Everything he taught years ago, still remains crystal clear in my head. I owe it all to his brilliant style of teaching.", "He was my biochem prof 2 years ago. Amazingly kind and hardworking. Extremely knowledgeable AND can teach! I worked in his lab for 2 years during my undergrad and he was helpful (and forgiving!) as a supervisor. He teaches more than just amphoteric proteins, you learn about life and how it is never too late to go after something you truly want.", "i think he is the best prof in university. course is designed in really good way.", "Murray is the best prof Biochem has ever seen! (There's a reason why he won the award 2 years ago!) He was my thesis prof, and I won't ever trade him for anything else. Murray is the reason I did Biochem! He's an extremely helpful guy, and is very dedicated to his research.", "He's really willy wonka in disguise! He makes chocolate at his biochem lab.", "great prof! gotta love him!", "One of the best profs u'll come across.  Extremely clear and thorough with explanations.  Offers help whenever u need it.  Overall, a great teacher.  Quizzes are difficult sometimes, but they make you think and u understand the material quite well as a result.", "Excelent prof! But, having no midterm or final is questionable.", "Excellent prof! His quizs are a bit tough, but make you think! He's really good at what he does because he is one of the few people at Uni NOT there just for the research! Great teacher and great person to talk to for undergra academic help. Nothing but great respect for this man!", "The most amazing prof i have ever had in my life. Simply THE BEST!! His enthusiasm at 8:30 in the morning is splendid. You dont need coffee to stay up in his class, his teaching will do that. Outside the class, he is also a gentleman. Loves interacting with class, and helps u whenever in need. LOVE him!", "Wow, this guy loves what he does and it shows!  Great prof, and a great person.  Enjoyed his class very much.", "Great Prog, always wants to help students learn and encourages the love of learning.  Always there if you need help or have questions and is patient.  Great prof!", "Junop is the best prof at McMaster. Should get a teaching award.", "so enthusiastic, very approachable, very fair, made me excited about proteins even at 8:30 am", "Never had him as a prof, though know him through the department.  He is a true gentleman and profesional.  Very thoughtful and is an adamant advocate for undergraduate education at MAC.", "Great lecturer, although his notes tend to be a bit messy.

course. Not offered every year since Hoppe's the only one who teaches it. Assignments: 70% (14% x 5), but with friends, you should be able to get 100% every time. He reuses old assignment questions. Exam was similar to the assignment but is tricky, uses the same concepts, only 30%. His lectures are interesting but people don't show up.", "Funny guy, loved his lectures because he was very insightful. The key to doing well in this course is doing all the homework problems since they'll be a subset of the tests & exam, but you should really know your concepts well. Go to his office hours, he'll enthusiastically answer your questions and make sure you understand. 10/10 would take again.", "This is class was very similar to stats 2D03; he attempted to be interactive by bringing in dice, cards and paddle boards but at times the material was very repetitive and he wasn't very good at managing his time for the class to cover everything", "No real office hours. Graded the hard exam VERY LATE. You could tell he was a research prof and has low priority on teaching. I guess the only upside was that he's nice.", ":( - stay away!!!!!", "I don't attend his class anymore because he reads off his slides, and his slides are horrible. Have the material isn't on them and when he solves problems he skips many steps. Please explain", "Best STats professor on campus. If you want to be challenged and want to learn how to think deeply on Assignments, I suggest you take Dr. Hoppe's classes.", "One out of 5 is too much for this professor. He is the most unhelpful person in the whole world.", "Even though I got an A- in this course, I think I deserved an A+. His exam was unfair and brought my mark down. I wish he had dropped our lowest Assignment, which he did not considering the one on Martingale's was so unfair.", "Toughest Statistics Professor in the History of Mankind. His Assignments were a nightmare and impossible to solve on your own and his final was more challenging then expected.", "Very unfair professor. His exams consist mostly of questions you have never seen before. Way harder then the Assignment problems. I suggest that he start giving more fair exams.", "Extremely unfair prof. He really does not care about students. His exam was so hard.", "Definitely the worst prof ever.", "He would put me to sleep in Winter 2005. Early Morning Nap Time was his Lecture. Very Hard Multiple Choice Tests", "He was really the worst professor you can possibly imagine. His take home final was impossible and very hard. He acts very cool but he is veryyyy uncool. He doesnot like giving good marks to students.", "This prof is really really stale. His lectures should be flushed. They are so stinky!!!", "After the first lecture itself I realized he was going to be a terrible prof.", "He is the most unfair and unreasonable prof I have ever had. Stay away from him if you are a grad student.", "Boring Beyond Words", "He was terrible when I took his course in Winter 2005. He took forever to answer emails and sometimes he simply would not bother replying. He is rude arrogant and tries to be nice in front of the class. He is overall terrible. You should take a course taught by him if you want to be turned off the subject material for good. Thumbs down for Hoppe.", "Prepared me well for grad courses.  Tough course but fair marking and Dr. Hoppe is great in office hours.", "I had this professor for Stats 4E03 last year and his take home final was the hardest thing you can imagine. He really does not want to see students do well, that's why he messes them up in the end. Avoid this prof. His voice will put you to sleep and he uses overheads way too much, which nobody likes really. Very boring and tough instructor. BAD!!", "Freddy was really boring for first year stats", "HE IS A REALLY TOUGH PROFESSOR", "First of all, he is the worst stats prof ever due to his incredibly dull and boring lectures. Secondly he is really tough. He told in class that exams are not supposed to be a war between students and profs, but he lied. He gave a really hard final because the class average was very high in the term and he wanted to lower it. Terrible prof. Avoid!!", "I had him for brownian motion and found him to be extremely boring. His lectures will put you to sleep. His Assignments were so tough!!!", "He's fair and accommodating.  Explains concepts well.  Not really a hard course if you do the work.", "He was so terrible for that course when I had him about 4 years ago. Just couldn't stand him. Most boring prof ever. And to make worse, his tests were hard too!!", "Worst Prof Ever. His lectures are soooooooo booorrrinng and he gives impossibly hard assignments that will surely make your head hurt. I dont recommend this prof or his courses to anyone.", "He needs to give more reasonable assignments!", "Assignments were very hard", "AmazING prof", "Dr.Hoppe is a bit tough, but he is a very fair professor. Dont get freaked out if you find out you don't know how to do the first couple Assignments in the course. He really cares about his students and their grades and will do everything he can to make sure people who are trying their best get good grades. He has good intentions for his class.", "VERY BORING and VERY HARD prof. No kidding. DONOT take his course. You will regret it. His exams are most unfair ever. Avoid him.", "Excellent professor.  Tests were marked fairly.", "Damn, he was an alright prof. Considering a lot of the inclass notes were not based on his tests. Everything was good until the exam... It consisted of stats questions from other courses (being sarcastic, but thats what it seemed like). SO many people did bad on that exam..... And its not like he bell curved at the end", "High fives all the way.  Great prof.  Fair.", "fair!  (and that doesn't happen often)", "A really great professor. DO NOT TAKE 4E03 BEFORE 3U03 or 4D03. 4E03 is MUCH harder than 2D03. He is a fair professor. Just come to class and do the work. Tests are based on homework questions.", "Fairly clear and very engaging. He honestly cares about his students and is very fair about grades and scheduling. Stats would have bored me to death without him!", "I agree.  The course was easy even with a lot of work but the tests and exams were fair and just like the practice ones.  I got an A+ and would take a course again with Dr. Hoppe.", "Great all round.", "Dr. Hoppe is fair and excellent kindly professor.  This is not course for sissies because he covers lot of material but puts notes online and gives practice tests.  Just do problems and you'll get A because tests and exam are fair and based on the lectures. He uses good examples from newspapers.  He knows stats.", "stutters and takes too long to explain a simple concept. Just stands up there and scribbles on overhead sheets. pre-printed notes are unclear and he doenst explain the things you need to know. Tests were hard but final exam was easy. I stopped going to his class after a few weeks and still managed to do well", "Dr. Hoppe is hands down the best prof I have had in first year. He has a heart made of gold. He is kind, caring, fair, and genuinely cares about his students. I hope to have him for some more courses in upper years. Thumbs up for this guy.", "Amazing prof!!! He gave everyone 3 free marks on the second test. Has lot of concern for students. I've never seen such a generous prof before. Will do everything he can to help you. EXTREMELY Helpful on the webct discussion forums.", "bad prof all around.  doesnt answer emails promptly.  doesnt even send an email to say that he got your email.  so rude.  thinks hes a good prof which makes him an extra bad prof.", "Such a great teacher and a great person. He is more forgiving and caring than most profs at McMaster. Understands life's pressures, treats students well. Let us drop our lowest midterm. Exams are not easy but fair. Lots to study in the course though. He's a very good man.", "One of the most helpful profs ever", "I cant blame him for how dull stats is! He tris very hard to make you interested in statistics! Although reading the book helps just as much as attending the lectures.", "Hoppe is a pretty cool prof, tries to make it interesting, its not his fault he likes statistics...but dude this guy gets paid maddd money!", "great guy", "The labs take too long to do.  Lectures are fun though.  He interacts with the class.", "It's a good course, but I don't understand the need for excel assignments (and they are only worth 10 percent) yet so much work!! Course would be a lot more enjoyable without the boring labs!", "Uses good examples.   Genuinely interested in the subject and tries to make it interesting.", "Good teacher.", "Excellent class.  Tries hard to explain theoretical concepts with concrete examples.  Very approachable.", "very clear and patient.", "Really helpful prof", "Hoppe is an okay proff, even though his lectures can get increadible boring.  However it is his personality that discusts me.  Trys to be friendly but in person he is a complete jerk. I have absolutly no respect for the man.  but go figure he is a statistion and not a real mathmatition anyways.", "Nice guy, but incredibly boring. I went to class to sleep. The first 2 tests were easy as pie, the exam was a lot harder than expected. GL.", "cant understand what this man is trying to say. can ace class by not going to class and doing his online examples and old online exams. same exact ones are on midterm and final.", "Graphs and graphs and sometimes explanations. Understood nothing. Grade went up 20% when I stopped going to class and learned from book only. Is a prof for research, not for teaching.", "I still don't understand the purpose of the course. Hoppes seemed like a nice guy, based on the 10 lectures I attended. I learned one thing: you can waste a lot of paper printing his lecture notes, and end up MORE confused than when you started.", "never really understood him or what he was trying to teach. like the fact that if your exam mark is better than a midterm, the midterm doesn't count and the exam is worth more. i hate stats.", "No Comments", "He let us drop a midterm if the exam mark was better...I went up like 20% because of that!!! :-)", "All the material is online which is great if you don't feel like going to class.  Prof is witty at times and is fair with marks and exams.   Answers questions on WebCT too.", "Sleep inducing class. Seems like a nice enough man. Class in general is terrible. I've never seen attendance drop so fast in my entire life.", "says thing implies you are stupid because he gradurated in Princton,and says&quot;do U have more questions to ask me&#63;&quot;make sure U don't want to see him again.Keep a coat in his lecture,room temperature drops when he walks in ,so 90%empty seats ar", "In one class some kid answered a question, and he let the kid take his mike and teach the class from the front...even better was when Dr. Hoppe sat in the kid's seat while this was goin on", "He gave the best of four wasy to calculate the final mark and raised the final exam.   One of my only profs to tell noisy students to be quiet.", "good prof", "I had him last year, and he was amazing. Everybody should stop cutting him up, because Dr.Hoppe is the man", "I didn't ever want to take another stats class for fear i might get Dr. Hoppe again. I went to speak to him during his office hours and he was rude and mean. You need to work on your people skills.", "One of the most brilliant professors I have ever had...classes are a little boring but still, a great class and professor!", "Basically a good class.", "A boring, boring man.  When he pulls out a coin, take out your pillow.  Don't be shy there are plenty of empty seats to stretch out in.", "He sometimes is a bit unapproachable for questions, but overall teaches a good class and makes a fair exam...if you are in his class next semester you should be really happy", "Professor is interested in the subject and tries to make the material relevant.  Goes very fast, that's my only complaint, but there is a lot of material to cover.  Web site is very useful.  I liked the practice tests and exams.", "He is the best prof I have had at Mac.  I loved his probability examples", "Looks like Mario, but a very boring prof to listen to.  Tests are moderately difficult but can be tricky if you do not know the concepts well.  Though he is fair in weighting of marks and will adjust your final grade from two or three options.", "Hoppe rocks", "Excellent prof.  Tough though.  Gives no credit for assignments that are only a little late.  Great web site.", "where do i start&#63;&#63;!! Rude, arrogant, boring, unhelpful, unclear...and the list goes on...i LOOOOVE Mcmaster but he's the only prof whose class i loathed!!", "Some first year students are the rude ones.  They don't appreciate quality instruction and don't like the work expected.", "He is rude and arrogant. A know-it-all yet he doesn't help students.", "Very rude Proff.

Her English is TERRIBLE and she just pretty much reads from the slides.", "She seems nice at first, but I approached her to speak to her about a question on my test, and she said that she doesn't care about the students as long as the class average is acceptable to the registrar, so I don't recommend this course for anyone who doesn't need it.  It's too bad, I heard this used to be a great class.", "Never take this course with her if you don't have to.  She willingly admits that she made a mistake in the marking of her tests, but she was unwilling to do anything about it, she is unapproachable, and when students ask questions, she is condescending and most of the time she can't even remember the material herself that she expects us to remember", "She's by far the worst professor I've had. She cannot teach, and not only that, her tests were ridiculously absurd and hard. The &quot;desgin an experiment&quot; questions were hard, and we were being tested on stuff that were extracted from the paper by ourselves, NOT on what she taught us. And she loves immunopercipitation, almost every paper had it.", "This prof made tests that were basically impossible. She makes you design experiments for things she barely mentioned in class and never once explains how to actually design an experiment. She also makes one-word overheads with tons of pictures that aren't explained at all and makes you read 800 journal articles just to semi-figure them out.", "One of my worst prof's at this university.  Her tests are brutal and ambiguous, then to make things worse, she arbitrarily assigns marks to questions because nobody got the right answer.  However these alterations help some of the class, while the rest of the class got screwed.  This could have been a good class if she wasn't teaching it.", "Definitely the worst prof I have ever had.

Lectures are not presented logically and had I not taken microbial genetics and cellular biochem I would have done terribly. Used to be a good course, she ruined it.", "Terrible prof - she called the whole class stupid.  Formal complaints were lodged with the chair of the department.

His notes are done in such good detail you will never touch the textbook unless you're doing practice problems. To succeed do all the practice problems and go to lecture.", "Great prof! had him for 1x03 so funny.", "He's a good prof. I wouldn't say amazing, but still pretty good. It's pretty easy to get at least a B in this course. If you want that A+ you better work for it. Assignments were very generously marked. Assignments require some extra thinking and are meant to PUSH you. Accept that push to improve otherwise you will get DRAGGED.", "Best prof ever Lots of work to do.", "\"Stan the man!\" If he is teaching Real Analysis II, definitely take it. His lectures are very clear and the notes are thorough. His tests are extremely fair and graded kindly. If you're stuck on a concept make use of his office hours, he'll walk you through and elucidate everything! ", "Best prof in the world! I <3 you Stana Llama.", "Best prof ever!! He wants his students to do well. HIs tests/exams are fair.", "Great prof, got an easy 12. I wish he was teaching my other math courses as well. His notes are soo descriptive (though tiring to write), that u dont have to use the textbook at all except to do homework problems. Make sure u take it with him, and also he has 2-3 grading schemes and u can easily get a 12 even if u mess up one of the tests.", "Best professor ever!!!!!! He is always willing to help, tests are fair, and he makes lectures entertaining. LOVE HIM!", "Awesome prof!! dont miss the chance of having a class with him", "A hilarious guy and easy to understand/learn from in lecture. Haven't had a better math teacher at Mac so far.", "Very good, clear, fun, and explains topics really well", "This class was easy, and not pointless, if you think that, you just didn't understand the material and shouldn't be there. In one example he did, you have to solve your equation with the line y=x, and people were lost. That's sad, thats something you learn in highschool. Hes won the best prof award @Mac, and deserves to win it more times.", "Dr. Alama is a very fair prof, If you don't think his class is fair, you are not trying or going to class. I found this class challenging, but he never gives you tests which you can't do. If you're having trouble GO TO HIS OFFICE HOURS, he wants you to do well. Don't blame him hes fair, for higher level classes they're abstract, and should be tough", "I've read some of the comments and Dr. Alama is one of the best prof's ever. He honestly wants you to do well. His midterms/exams are completely fair, the course itself is a hard topic but he does an excellent job of teaching it you just have to put in the effort. DO THE PRACTICE WORK HE ASSIGNS!", "Amazing in every sense of the word. An asset to the math department.", "Most over-rated prof ever. His exams were hard and unfair. I dont recommend this nuisance course MATH 3DC3 to anybody. You will just be wasting your time. The non-sense you learn in this course is not applicable to real life, and it is a really difficult course. The final exam was much harder then the tests. Alama is a boring prof. OVER-RATED PROF", "Very bad professor. He did not even ask questions on the final exam from the easy part of the course (the last part) he only asked questions from the tough part. Very brutal for a useless course.", "Dr. Alama is an excellent professor. His lecture style is informal and friendly. Material is very well presented and is as clear as real analysis could possibly be made. Office hours are packed yet he continues to explain without the slightest hint of annoyance... very valuable course if you are serious about math.", "He is definitely harder then Professor Lovric. More tougher tests", "Dr. Alama please make the tests easier OK &#63;", "HE was my favourite prof. Our final exam was held IN A CLASSROOM (!!!!) Just make sure you sit besides someone smart. Very easy to ace the exam due to the fact that, it's held in the regular classroom everyone writing the same version ;) :)", "No Comments", "Great Prof! He's so funny but no one laughs in class... I appreciate the humour/quirkiness though. Very helpful and the tests are fair :)", "I think McMaster gives teaching awards to profs who just write notes on the black board most of the time without making much eye contact or explaining enough. He needs to type up those notes and put it on his website, or a courseware and actually focus on explaining stuff more. I was not very pleased with my experience in his class.", "No Comments", "He was great. He holds the final exam IN A CLASSROOM of Hamilton Hall. It was so easy to cheat because everyone sits next to each other on the final exam. I knew nothing still I aced the exam", "Nice guy but tests and final are hard", "People claiming his Analysis tests are 'too hard,' that's what abstract math is. Real Analysis is a hard subject for 90% of people. Alama explains things to crystal clarity, and he often repeats the necessary definitions prior to proving a concept. If anyone got a bad mark in 3A, it's not Alama's fault...It's Real Analysis's fault for being tricky.", "He is very over-rated. He just writes on the board most of the time. A lot of people find that their hand starts hurting after his lecture. Why can't he just type that stuff up and put the slides on the website. His teaching is not great and his tests/exams are unreasonbly difficult. He is not an easy marker either but he's better then Lia bronsard", "Your real Analysis tests were very hard!!!", "Stan Alama is a very tough prof. His tests are brutal", "As a person he is very nice, but he writes tough finals.", "He is my best prof", "A+", "Great prof. Exams are tough but the prof is good.", "Honestly one of the best profs at mcmaster, 3A was not an easy course but his teaching is interesting and the assignments/tests were fair if you do the homework you'll do well. GO TO CLASS, he doesnt teach from the textbook, he often teaches things that are relavent to the textbook, he honestly wants you to do well, so ask if you need help!", "Very helpful prof. and kind heart person. Always fair to students and more than happy to provide helpful.", "MATH3DC3: Amazin proffessor, but the course is more difficult than I had expected. I thought it would be a recipe course, but it's not easy stuff.", "He's one of the most awesome math professors at McMaster University!!", "Well he did a good job. Very good prof. I cant say anything else except for the fact that I still hate Analysis.", "Alama rules. 3A is a very hard course, however with Alama even though you might not get the best grade, you will learn. Lots.", "Wonderful prof", "Great prof", "Great proff, incridable clear and found he made analysis one of the easier classes last semester how ever i am just slightly mad that we were told we could use our text second semester but we can't, there goes another 150!! excellent examples, clear proffs etc,good pacing, good blackboard skills", "What a great math professor. The only person who has ever made Analysis easy to understand. Tests are fair and he is a very clear instructor. However, be prepared to be overcome with the desire to shave his mustache during class...I warned you!", "Overall a good professor.", "He is a very good professor, excellent teaching", "Not bad... a little hard to understand because of the mumbling, and constant corny jokes.  Notes are very extensive (however helpful), but occasionally hard to read b/c writing is so small.", "really good proff.  one the bests i had", "Love the metaphors!

Weekly quizzes, daily vocabulary quizzes, and post-chapter exercises means a lot of homework but also a lightly weighted final exam (there's no midterm). Dr. Eilers makes learning a whole new language almost easy. He's a super friendly and funny guy, one of the best profs I've ever had.", "AMAZING lecturer, hilarious. If you need help from him, just ask and he will make the time for you. Makes Latin even more interesting than it already is. ", "Eilers was an excellent and fun prof- I was dreading classics, having taken it to fill up my course load, but he ended up making it somewhat interesting, I now read about classical antiquity for fun. His Elvis interlude is the stuff of undergrad legend. I'd say he's good overall, but that he does not suffer fools gladly.", "Eilers is amazing. He really knows how to make the course fun.", "BEST PROF EVER. I'm in life sciences and I took Latin as an elective; although everyone says Latin is the hardest language, Dr.Eilers makes it very interesting and easy to learn. As long as you do your homework constantly, you'll do great in the course", "Very interesting course. Prof. Eilers is very enthusiastic and goes the extra mile to make it the best course possible. The only downside to this course is insane workload (this is intensive course, you have to work every day and memorize A LOT!). Keep that in mind if you are taking other tough courses.", "Prof. Eilers is very smart and devoted professor. He is not the easiest, his course requires lot's of work but this is what all courses should be.           I have no regrets taking latin...", "Eilers is amazing.  I hated to miss a lecture.  He must've changed since the other commenters had him, because he never once yelled and his lectures were always clear.  He made Latin fun -- and easier because I was having fun.  The Songs and the tangents about history and the evolution of the language were always a highlight.", "One of the worst profs I've ever had. Yells at students who come in late/leave early, tho he did this himself very often. Makes fun of you for getting answers wrong. Mean, unapproachable, unhelpful, unprofessional and rude. Avoid like the plague. His lectures could be decent but he is so mean and unhelpful, the class is impossible.", "Not exactly the best lecturer. Very easy class, though. Entertaining to hear him sing in latin", "Hated this class.  I was in third year when I took it, which was a big mistake.  Moodle takes up too much time.  Made me feel really uncomfortable because he made fun of his students when they got answers wrong.  Not cool.  Elvis in Latin was pretty good though.", "interesting", "&quot;Jesus&#63;&quot; Dr. Eilers is hilarious and a great prof. He will make fun of you if you come late to Latin, but he's very approachable. His Moodle exercises are intense, but he gives you a really solid foundation in Latin. As the Undergraduate Advisor, Eilers is AMAZING because he gets back to you really quickly and can get your into classes", "Overall enjoyed him. He makes the information interesting and has a good sense of humour. Notes are difficult due to the fact that his slides do not use titles and he jumps between topics a lot. Definitely make sure to attend lectures since it is where most of the exam questions come from.", "i LOVED this prof. he was hillarious, and taught in a way that made the material engaging. thumbs wayyy up! ;)", "He is often off topic. He has a &quot;no talking during lecture&quot; rule. I got kicked out of class because the person beside me kicked my foot, they said sorry, and I said &quot;that's okay&quot;. He yells at people for being late or leaving early, but he was late/left early twice a month. Tests/exams not difficult (if you can follow his lectures)", "Dr. Eilers is one of the few profs I actually enjoyed this year. Funny, and keeps what is usually a boring topic entertaining. LOVE HIM!", "Hilarious, needs to be more fluid with transition between material. Good Job!", "Suuuppeerraabiimmmuusss", "Lots of memorization, but really easy.", "very helpful...and funny", "Off topic all the time. Not interesting, stutters to the point its distracting. Hard midterms/exams. He did give us good essay topics with bibliographies. He never covers all the material. Slow, and boring class. Not approachable, very scary. His slides suck, they give you way to much info, and not enough of what\u2019s important.", "Amazing prof, i agree with the comments about the lectures, but his sense of humour makes up for it.  His exam wasn't bad at all.  When he says go to tutorial HE MEANS IT!", "Funny prof, makes you want to not miss lectures (just to see what he'll do, hard marker though, and stutters really bad, a 10 mintue lecture takes 50 minutes.

I found him very incoherent - I actually found myself missing Dr. George. Though intelligent, he often appears scattered.

I'd buy his book, but it's too expensive ^^;  I only wish he taught more classes!", "Was scared after his guest lecture, but Eilers is cool. Go Leafs! His style of lecturing makes for great notes, and I never missed a class. Smart, funny guy who knows his history!", "Knows his stuff inside and out.  Very funny if you get his special brand of humour.  Goes off on tangents, but most of the time they kind of relate.  A great course with a great exam.", "No Comments", "Best History class yet! Didn't miss a single lecture. Dr. Eilers rekindled my interest in ancient civilizations!!", "Dr. Eilers is the best. Loved the Elvis, loved the exam questions about Jack Sparrow and Dire Straits.

But don't quit your day job :)", "Go Eilers Go!", "He is a great prof.  His lectures are very enjoyable and filled with many jokes.  He has a tedency to go off on tangents.  But that doesn't matter because he just so great!", "Funny prof!  His jokes are funny, when u get them...cause half the time he doesn't finish and makes u figure out the rest 4 u'r self!  But great prof!", "Dr. Eilers is fun because of his jokes and the way he picks on the t.as. I was really scared of him when he did the guest lecture last term, but he's awesome.", "I stumbled upon this after hearing Dr. Eilers had &quot;googled himself&quot; and I wondered what would come up. Eilers rocks!", "Chris told me to fill this out and tell you that I love his pink shirt.  You're great...thanx", "extremely helpful - I don't know about &quot;easy&quot; ratings - He makes the class easy because he makes it enjoyable - tends to go off on tangents but they are not totally unrelated.  Excellent professor and he obviously enjoys his profession and lectu", "Eilers, you rock! My TA Chris Wallace told me to come on here and rate you. And I am not too sure why, but he said to say something about liking a pink shirt&#63;! well anyways, good class!", "My t.a. Chris told me to do this and also something about a pink shirt...great lectures!", "Chris told me to do this, and he said something about a pink shirt. Great class though, and he shoots about a 50% on the jokes, which is better than most!", "Chris made me do it, but I still think you're cool.", "what a grrrrreat prof! i really enjoy how he lectures..it's very clear and easily understandable!", "My TA Chris told me to do this. I like his pink shirt!", "My TA Chris told me to do this.I also enjoy the class very much, and I even find the professor's jokes funny.", "Entertaining, enthusiastic, and interacts with the students. The environment that Eilers creates is a comfortable and democratic one. For the first time I don't feel intimidated by a professor.", "Overly sensitive to student opinion... which is different from the norm. Generous and open to questions, his class has a nice casual feel. The &quot;eat muffin while talking&quot; has gotta go, but the coffee can stay.Approachable, a man of the people.An", "Cool guy, fun to listen to, definite pepper material.  Go Eilers, go!", "He's really not boring. You can tell that he enjoys what he talks about and that in turn makes me interested in what he has to say.  I would be lost in this course if it weren't for his lectures so I try not to miss them.  A great prof!", "An AWESOME Prof! A cool guy and really helpful... I now understand the past 13 years of school thanks to this guy! Keep up the good work!     (Hey Eilers, I hope this helps out your chili pepper situation.) ~MA~", "He's very funny.

Taken as an elective and failed due to her inability to just make tests how they should be and not a test to see who knows the best mix between answers A and B, B and C, C and A or all the above. If she wants to be taken seriously maybe she shouldn't TRY to make material harder than it really is.", "Class is in the evenings,  but midterms on Saturday mornings for some reason.

However, Fast herself isn't very approachable, MC questions are purposely misleading, and prof isn't very accommodating at all.", "Took this class for an easy elective and ended up dropping it after the midterm.

As a music major, I find the terminology simple. I think the communications students will say the same. There needs to be an essay in the course. I like a challenge and Dr. Fast does not present one. I will not take another course with her.", "Loved the course. Dr. Fast makes the material engaging and fun, and is also always available to lend a helping hand. One of my favorite profs of my university career.", "I did very well in the course.  Still, I can't believe she's allowed to teach.  Each of the reviews who said you have to agree with her to do well - she doesn't get what it means to be a teacher at all.  The course is easy if you spit back out exactly what she says.  Approachable outside of class, but hostile to opposing ideas in class.", "This was my favourite class of the year. The content was amazing, and despite what people say, her lectures make the subjects MORE interesting. I have not wanted to skip class once all semester. Granted, the exams are hard, but fair, as I know people who got 90s and others who got grades in the 60s.", "It's really no wonder this course is so popular! Dr Fast makes the material interesting, engaging, and thought-provoking. Yes, this means she will ACTUALLY make you THINK, so if that's a problem just DON'T TAKE THE COURSE. Dr Fast is smart, sharp, and brings cultural context into her classes. Overall, highly recommended!", "really cares about what she's teaching. studied countercultures through themselves, rather then from a textbook view. her multiple choice is impossible though, and despite how much i loved the class i felt terrible leaving my hands in the fate of impossibly worded m/c options. kind of killed my grade, but i'd take it again.", "fun, entertaining teacher. if you can take music 2II3, do it!the course material is great and pretty essential for any music lover.", "What was she thinking!&#63; I think Prof's need to be more self aware about their teaching abilities!

Very unorganized. Avoid this course if you can!!", "Lectures were kind of boring, didn't really add any insight, and she spent WAY too much time on Led Zeppelin.

Had another (far worse) prof originally on my schedule but ended up attending Lozinski's lectures because of their quality. Cheat sheet midterms/exams are not as easy as you would think, all of his questions are 'synthesis' style. People who think his pace is too fast or his tests too difficult should drop out of McMaster.", "Very nice and funny prof. So thorough and caring. Blessed my life. Would definitely take another class with him!", "So fast", "Dr. Lozinski is a great human being. I really appreciated his class, it was a perfect combination of examples and theory. He seems like he's always around Hamilton Hall if you need help with homework. Do the assignments and understand the theory and you should have no problem succeeding on the tests and exam.", "Although Lozinski seems to be a great guy, I found that his lectures really had nothing to do with the assignments or textbook work. His tests are the opposite of straightforward, as he throws in concepts he's never discussed or assigned before. I would spend days studying and still found myself struggling through his tests.", "Lozinski spends a significant portion of lecture explaining theory rather than grinding out examples. Be careful because he may ask for short answer theory related questions.  Easy to do well if you are prepared to attend all lectures and supplement with textbook work.", "He basically gives an example and proceeds to solve it without explaining how he got there, he just writes out the steps and doesn't give an explanation of what's going on.", "His tests are a little tricky but its only because he wants you to understand math and not memorize solutions. He's a good guy, but found that he often goes through lecture very quickly.", "He gives a very new approach to math compared to high school level. He emphasizes understanding the content rather than memorizing the formulas. Great prof", "great prof. but theory based lectures no examples done in class therefore tutorial  is must", "This class was challenging, but if you work hard and really learn the material a great mark is totally attainable. It turned out to be one of my favourite courses of first year. Dr. Lozinski's lectures were sometime's confusing, partly due to the content, but overall clear and absolutely worth attending. He is also very helpful at office hours.", "This professor is very dedicated to his students and teaches very clearly. I really enjoyed his lectures.", "Very approachable, really cares for his students. Thought he might be intimidating but actually super friendly :) ", "He was a great prof for Math 2Z03. You could tell he was willing to answer questions, and answered them quite well too. He did write quite a bit in terms of notes, but they were great to study off of and explained the concepts well. The tests were a bit difficult but if you do the practice problems an A is 100% doable.", "One of the few genuinely good profs in the department. He truly cares about students and is willing to help and listen to them. Tests/assignments were very fair and you could go ask him for hints/help. You need to study for his courses. Overall great prof", "Makes for a good teacher. He's highly intelligent, and great in class. Very impatient with students that slack.", "Great sense of humour, really thorough in explaining concepts. His enthusiasm for math and his positive attitude are contagious in class.", "Great prof and really cares abt the student.", "Really nice. He gives off this feeling that he really wants to help you. Great prof.", "He gives you clear notes (also posted on WebCT) so you don't even need the text (provided that you have MathZone to practise with). His tests and exam are very fair (easy if you study, hard if you don't). It's recommended that you attend his classes (interesting, not monotone, clear, organized and so on).", "Dr. Lozinksi is a good prof. He teaches in a very organized manner. He does write hard tests, but being my 2nd time thru this course, Ive noticed he's changed a lot this year to make the tests a lot more fair. He is very willing to help students in office hours and with other appointments", "Had such a bad experience in Actuarial I so after that I did not even bother taking Actuarial II. His tests are hard.", "I", "very bad professor his test were very hard. so what if it is a 3rd year stats course, he should still make it more fair.", "Lozinski is a great prof! Do not listen to what the people below have said. His tests are hard, but hey it's University math, what do you expect&#63; 1+1=2&#63; And about the whole thing with signing his name &quot;Dr Lozinski&quot;, I think he has every right to do that. I mean he slaved throughout his post-secondary education to get his PhD. DR LOZINSKI ROCKS!!!", "He is the worst math prof I've ever seen. So many people failed his tests. He thinks Actuarial was the only course we had in 3rd year and no other courses to worry about that's why he gave such hard tests and FOUR tests in a term. OMGGGGGG", "He is the most unfair prof I have ever met. After him, I dont think I have any interest left in Actuarial. His tests are ridiculous and so unfair. He needs to take it easy on students", "He is the wost prof EVERRR!!! His tests are so hard and unfair. He gave us 4 tests in one semester. That is not normal!! No prof in the math department would make a course that intense. For some people it has been a real struggle to even pass his tests. I strongly recommend you stay away from him. His voice is so soft and he is so boring. Terrible!", "He is the best prof in this disappointing math department here at Mac. Most profs have no teaching skills whatsoever, but not this prof. This prof is a skilled professional and is always ready for a challenge. You should go check him out. You will make him very happy!", "He is the best professor I have ever had. His teaching style is remarkable and his knowledge in the subject matter is excellent.", "Good prof, but he does have a HUGE EGO I suppose! That's why he always signs his emails with &quot;Dr. Lozinski&quot; I have never ever seen a University prof sign his email with the word &quot;Dr&quot; so I guess he wants to tell the world I DO HAVE A PHD and I am smart!! Feel sorry for him if he has that type of an attitude. Even on tests first page &quot;Dr. Lozinksi&quot;", "DOCTOR Lozinksi is really tough!!", "Amazing prof", "He was so condescending to me when I contacted him. It was very unexpected. If he didn't want to be helpful, he could have atleast been politer.", "Loved him. He is such a nice prof, really connects with his students, enthusiastic, and helpful. Tests and assignments were fair. Office hours were very helpful. Can't wait to have him again.", "Amazing!! One of the best profs at Mac till now. He was really fair with clear explainations and generated interest in the material.", "too hard...", "Dr. Lozinski is definitely one of the best profs I've ever had. His passion for the material shines through in his lectures, and his explanations are always clear, and frequently hands-on (vector sticks!). Tests were well-done; they make you feel like you're actually applying what you've learned. I can't overstate how awesome Dr. Lozinski is.", "He's always open to helping you, and unlike some other profs, going to him actually is worthwhile if you have a question. He's really thorough in class and gives good examples. His tests can sometimes be tricky though.", "Amazing teacher, very competent and goes through examples thoroughly and sincerely cares about his students.", "Took his course in the summer, excellent prof. He genuinely wants his students to do well, which is always a good thing.", "had him for algebra--he's very helpful and clearly wants to do a good job for his students.  i stopped going after a while because you can pick it up from the text, but he works through problems nicely in class.  sometimes a bit fast.  his nerdy jokes are cute and endearing.", "if u'r a genius on stats. then take his course otherwise ....a nightmare", "Awesome prof for both algebra and calculus. Always available to help and has good sense of humour. Kind of sexy too;)", "Very clear,very smart, even though the test was a little challenging, still a good course. Very nice prof, I like him.", "lozinski is a good prof, but he goes too fast sometimes, and assumes the class knows exactly what hes talking about.", "Always available for that extra explanation on course material.

And his love for his research is inspirational!", "Ben Evans was hilarious and cared very much for what he taught. Followed textbook pretty much to a T.

Really funny, really enthusiastic... loves talking about his research on frogs. Teaching is SUPER clear.

Side note- group projects (PBL) are annoying in this course... be sure to get yourself a good group and hope for easy TAs", "Talks fast, yes, but I think it's in part because he's excited about what he's teaching. He still delivers the information clearly though, and I'd definitely have him as a lecturer again.", "Ben's a great professor,  and exceptional individual.", "Very nice person.  He knew what he needed to improve on from the past and is really working at being a better lecturer.  His lectures are very interesting and you can feel his passion about the topics.  You will find his midterm very easy if you understood the concepts he talked about.", "This man literally talks at the speed of light. Like you gotta be talented as hell to talk that fast. Anyways, I stopped going to lectures and just watch the podcasts. He's not too bad though if you take your time and pause the podcasts and carefully listen. Love his excitement for frogs tho, always kills me!", "BEST PROR EVER!!! He's honestly so passionate about what he teaches, when he's up there lecturing its seems more like he's sharing all the cool things he knows.

I wish he taught all my classes 3", "I personally disliked this course soo much! The lectures were so boring, Dr evans speaking at lights speed didnt help either. You cant really take notes, And for some people like me, if u dont take notes, I cant focus! He was meh in terms of helpfulness. I found his midterms incredibly difficult, although quinn was much harder!  Dreaded going. ", "Dr. Evans is a really amazing prof. If his passion towards teaching doesn't motivate you to learn, then maybe his love for frogs will! He replies to e-mails at a much faster rate than most and is always able to answer your questions after lecture. Very quick speaker, don't be afraid to ask him to slow down. He's my favourite prof I've had this year", "Dr. Evans was definately the best profteacher i've ever had. He is passionate about his work which makes him that much better as a prof.

Hes the only prof I would ever attend an 830 for!!", "Dr. Hanley has been teaching french for a number of years, and it shows. This course is highly philosophical, and he teaches it enthusiastically. As a result, the material is endlessly interesting. He is kind, funny and smart, which make for great lectures.", "Dr. Hanley is great. Would recommend this course to anyone with basic knowledge of French. He was the only 1st year prof who actually cared about students and the small class size means he knows you on a first name basis. He also loves to make everyone speak as often as possible (for practice and just because he wants to get to know you). Easy A", "AMAZING prof. So smart and witty and you can tell he really cares about his students!", "His classes are a lot of fun and he really knows his stuff. He's also approachable and he provides you with everything you need to succeed in his course.", "Amazing prof. The best Fr. prof ive had at Mac. His class revolves around reading quotes from the novels and explaining them and class diss. The term essay was easy IF you go to class and take notes. He is extremely approachable, you should talk out the essay with him. The final was 2 of 3 essay questions. The course itself was really interesting.", "One of the best French teachers I have ever encountered. He loves his job and it really shows. Attend his classes - he loves to make jokes but also gets the job done. He makes the material very clear. Do your homework and don't forget to study vocabulary for his quizzes. Trust me, you want this prof!", "Seems like a sweet old man but can sometimes become quite rude. Make sure you do your homework or he'll blacklist you from the get-go. Gets frustrated easily but is an easy marker. Definitely self-righteous like most french teachers i've encountered.", "Dr Hanley is the best prof ever.  Explains everything super clearly and makes French interesting again.  Loved all of his classes and the books he chose.  All around excellent prof!", "Hanley is one of the best professors ever.  He is very sweet, truly cares about his students, is devoted to his area of study and his enthusiasm carries you along with it.  Highly recommended!", "The man does not teach.  His classes consist of nothing more than discussion that encourages the polemists to persist in fruitless argument.  This is accurate, and not libelous. Good if you love to hear your own voice, and don't care about the Truth.", "We called him &quot;Manly Hanley&quot; ... he rocked and made French rock too!!!", "Dr. H was a very caring and attentive listener. There were many occasions when he allowed me to vent to him or just chat with him during his office hours. I am a teacher now, and I strive to treat my students the way he treated us. Merci pour votre aide!", "This guy bugs me. He's a nice guy but a really overenthused teacher. No one cares and it's a good place to want to sleep, but he's so in your face!", "A wonderful man and terrific educator. His intellect is astounding as is his generosity.", "He is the BEST prof EVER!!!", "Nice man, perhaps too much spoonfeeding", "Excellent prof,wonderful human being,  that makes him somewhat sexy", "hard marker but an incredible and friendly teacher.", "Dr. Hanley has high expectations, but he is a very nice man and is never rude.", "No Comments"], "credit": ["Yes", "Yes", "Yes", "Yes", "N/A",

Just scroll down and you'll see. Lectures are poor, textbook is poor, and additional resources are poor. If you want a good grade, you're on your own.

Surprising that he hasn't been fired yet.", "His textbook just spits out a bunch of formulas, and talks about random concepts unrelated to the actual calculations.

Good luck:)", "Horrible professor, expects you to learn from his self-published, error filled textbook which won't fully explain concepts, and then tests you on concepts not in the book or lecture notes.. Finance has become the worst and hardest class I've taken at McMaster, and it's purely because of him.", "Get ready to not pass his course.

He is really really sweet guy but he is not really doing a good job teaching 2nd year finance.", "He is just too bad!", "Horrible prof, doesn't realize he's teaching an intro class and thinks everyone has at least 2 years of finance classes. Doesn't teach any of the basics of finance just bs formulas that make it look more like a calc course than a finance course. If you've never taken a finance before you will struggle as he only teaches what ever is in his bs text", "The textbook is poorly explained. It often just gives you the equations and answers and random concepts and expects you to figure out how everything fits together on your own. In lectures, he goes through examples, but he expects you to already understand all the steps he is taking even though the textbook hardly explains steps. It's a mess.", "He needs to stop using his full of error, self-written book.

He is disrespectful to students, careless, and worst of all his textbook is filled with mistakes and is incredible unclear. Horrible.", "The worst prof. I have ever encountered.

He is very rude to students. His text is full of mistakes and he expects way too much from students in an introductory course. His textbook for the course wasn't even endorsed by a publisher due to it's poor quality. His midterms are definitely not representative, so make sure you know everything..", "His textbook is not great. He expects people to already know finance. His examples are not clear, we have to figure out how to do certain questions on our own. Not an easy course. Torture.", "only way I passed the course was  because he made the midterms similar to the practice ones. other than that, extremely boring, confusing, and his textbook might as well not be written in english it's that difficult to understand", "Don't buy the textbook, it's full of useless junk and he just wants to make a buck off his classes. He's smart, but he can't teach at all. Definitely a self teaching class. He needs to explain more in his lectures!", "Thinks he invented Finance.

No respect or concern for his students.", "This guy is the worst prof i've ever had.

Ridiculously useless proff, just as bad if not worse then the stats proffs in 2nd year Buchanan and sproul", "completely useless textbook which he assumes people ALREADY have a background in finance, WHICH WE DON'T!! its an introductory course FOR GOODNESS SAKE!  Lecture is somewhat helpful, but not overly, lecture is A LOT more helpful than the textbook, but that doesn't mean much.", "His textbook is absolutely horrible, needs to provide a real textbook and then it make his mediocre lectures actually help", "His book is not that great on its own but if you read it and go to class everything makes perfect sense. All you need to do is read and do practice problems and your are set for exam. His true or false are extremely tricky but calculation questions are very straight forward if you know what you are doing.", "Didn't think he was that bad. Huge bell curve helped.

We got easy Qs in Class anyone could solve and brutal webs of a numerical mess on the exams. Geez..balance it out", "Wooooaaaaw you know you have a bad prof when his M/C tests dont even have the right choices on them. He doesn't know how to teach... he should stick to writing books. Worst professor I have  ever had, hands down.", "WORST PROF EVER in my two years of school. He talks gibberish in class. I dont think he has ever heard of the term &quot;EXAMPLES&quot;. How does he expect us to learn how to do maths without doing examples in class&#63;&#63;&#63; His coursepack is useless. Not to mention he has no concern abt any of his students, NONE AT ALL!!!", "Sucked.  So insecure, he attempts to treat MBA students like freshmen by talking down to you.  Heaven forbid you ask a question or start a discussion.  He prefers it to be a lecture course in which he can stand at the front and puke up info at you with no exchanges whatsoever.  Do yourself a favour - take Macro with ANYONE else.", "Worst Prof ever, does not help at all, and finds joy in failing students with ridiculous questions on the midterm and exam. This guy should not be teaching finance!!", "His courseware is good so you can buy the textbook but dont worry about buying the study guide. He is sort of an annoying little man but not a bad guy, thoroughly interested in what he teaches.", "Probably the worst prof you will encounter in 2nd year commerce. More interested in using pretentious words than clarifying concepts. Courseware is horribly written and this guy honestly just doesnt seem to know how to teach.

Teaches you to do things 'smart, not dumb'. Gives bonus questions on tests and exams - so marks over 100% are possible!", "Kolster doesn't insult your intelligence. If you study the material WELL, you will not only get a good grade but also learn the material very well. His lectures are peppered with jokes which lighten up what can be somewhat dry material sometimes. He believes in a single midterm, and instead gives assignments which are decently easy to do.

You need to work hard to appreciate this course", "Best professor at McMaster!  Very fair, very consistent.

He spoke with a thick german accent and his handwriting was impossible to decipher. He is extremely old but still takes his courses so seriously it's unbelievable. At this age people should stop worrying so much about students and marking hard on exams.", "His hand writing is the worst among all professors of the math department. My 2 year old daughter can write better then Manfred Kolster. He told us the exam will be so easy; it was not easy. It was pretty brutal. I was expecting an A+ in this course but walked out with an B+ because the final was pretty tough. I think Raza marked brutal on it.", "Very Unfair prof. He has very little knowledge of what he teaches. He makes so much mistakes on the board and then laughs about it and makes dumb jokes.

I learnt more from the TA", "Dr.Kolster is excellent at teaching. Obviously, if the only thing you know in Linear Algebra is row-reducing a matrix you will be diappointed in Math 2R03 with any prof and not just Dr.Kolster.

Out of every prof I've seen, Kolster's handwriting is the worst. Never provides any sample questions for exams, so they are quiet unpredictable. He's a two faced liar, that sweet talks on your face but gets a sadistic pleasure out of failing students or giving low marks.", "His classes were quiet boring since he mostly did theory on the board. Midterm exam wasn't that bad (Class average 75%) but the final was absolutely brutal. He told us the final exam would be easy. Lied to us.  Lot of people dropped his course. The assignments were very theoretical and tough. 55% average on Asst 1. He was too tough on summer class.", "Terrible prof. Just terrible.", "***WORST*** professor I've ever encountered. This man is an extremely harsh grader. He marks with no mercy whatsoever if you don't have what he wants as an answer. You write so much and he gives marks like 0/5 if he's not happy. You try to reason with him, or beg and plead for 1 more mark, he ain't gonna give it to you. A very stubborn prof.", "In all honesty Kolster is the WORST math prof I've seen at McMaster. His handwriting is extremely unclear...scribles on the board...his accent is really annoying. He does only theory in lecture and expects you to learn a lot of stuff on your own.

Can't wait to have her again!", "She was great at relating ideologies and philosophies with the present. A lot of righting but the course was fun.", "Complete crap. Her lectures are not organized in such a way that you can easily understand the concepts or information given. I had to reformat all of my notes and resort to the text book to make sure that she covered the topics that were important. She is also extremely slow not when speaking, but the pace of the lecture.", "Not a very good teacher. Didn't really catch the material in her class too well because she was not exactly the best at explaining it. Not that I'm a slow learner or anything (I'm a straight A student, her class included), I'm actually learning in all my other classes.

She is so nice and helpful... and you can always tell that she really loves her field of study! Very enthusiastic speaker!", "At first her enthusiasm is overwhelming but then you realize that she just LOVES history! I really like her and she seems like a prof really interested not only in their topic but in teaching too! She's is particularly nice and easy to talk to!", "I disagree w/ the previous post. I can see your point about the cost for 2nd text since isn't req'd reading, but I found it very useful.  And, her lecturing is only boring if you do not enjoy the topic... I like her a lot and find her lectures clear and informative.  She's also very helpful if you talk to her after class.", "Has anyone that has already written taken her class&#63; She is dull and boring. She completely hijacked this course which was supposed to be on Medieval Society and changed it into a course on the Italian Renaissance.

WE ARE POOR STUDENTS!", "Take this class if you want some unfactual information, and are interested in seeing a prof murder the French Revolution.", "Enthusiastic and passionate about her work.  Super friendly and funny while in lecture.  Really makes the class and topic fun.", "Super friendly, very enthusiastic and passionate about her field.", "Interesting and entertaining lectures.

The notes were really clear and everything, I just think the purpose of organic chemistry is to screw you over, so it's not a bad reflection on Dr. Valliant at all in my mind, it just sucks that we were required to take the course.", "THE worst class ive had the misfortune of taking in my life!  And that says a lot in itself.  Though Dr. Valliant may make a wonderful public speaker, the course itself was so horrible.  I cant wait for the end of the year so that I can bury my organic chem books and never look at them ever again!!!", "Clear examples and explanations in class, but watch out for the second test and final!", "very tough prof", "Very eloquent speaker..highly impressive...good flow of lectures and followed textbook quite closely which was good. However the tests did not follow the textbook&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63; Therefore he tests did not reflect the lectures appropriately&#63;", "Very good prof, explains things stepwise.  Very effective way of teaching class despite the difficulty of the course.  Tests were hard, but the lectures were awesome.  Many things were learned.  Candy is great too!", "I just had the second test of the term. The hardest thing I ever saw. Discussion forums on the course web site are full already! Aprt from screwing people over, good in class.", "well he's just too HOT to not go to class. So good looking. also very interesting to listen to. I can't help but feel in a trance when I hear him talk and look into his eyes.", "Not as clear as other profs.", "Whoever said he enjoys screwing over his students is bang-on!", "Terrible", "The tests and exam are killer. I don't really understand what's his appeal. He seems to enjoy screwing his students over.", "he's an absolutely awesome professor. Not only is he good at teaching, he also gives out candy, takes class pics, and is SO FUNNY ! i luved going to his classes", "True, it was a hard class... but his lectures were awesome and he was always willing to help!  And he is soooo hot!", "His tests were brutal, his lectures were very fast and he discouraged people from asking queistions because it slowed him down.", "Nice guy - his tests are killer tho! Sometimes he just bulldozes through the material without really seeming to care that more than half the class doesn't have a clue to whats going on", "The man teaches well, however posts blank lecture notes, which are off no use!  The tests and exam weren't great either.", "he's great and always makes the effort to make his students laugh. and it is true, he is very hot!", "he's a great professor very helpful very approachable!

Also, I have to say that I loved his breakdowns of midterms/exam - straight to the point, fair, and quite helpful.", "I love his philosophies on life and little quirks that goes on in life.

He often talks about how much he loves the math department at mcmaster and his colleagues, who are true mathematicians. He said he is very lucky to be working here. Very respectful professor.", "His classes really make you think. If you want to learn how to be a deep thinker, be sure to take every course taught by him. Excellent professor. He has a great social life. He is very friendly with students. When you go to his office, he engages in lengthy conversations about intiutive mathematical concepts. Really a pleasure to know him.", "He was a great prof. He really wanted you to learn. As long as you were willing to learn things, he did an excellent job of teaching it. He was very approachable, and always seemed to be in a good mood.", "He's my favourite prof.", "excellent professor. For me he is # 1.

I took Minoo's math3Z03 course since people said it was so easy, a &quot;bird&quot; math-credit, and he gave me a B+ even though I got excellent marks on the assignments, did great presentations. It was very unexpected and came off as a huge shock. He even gave B's and B-'s to some.", "Ken is a greeeeeeeeeat prof. Ooooh yeaaaah!", "Best prof ever. Has genuine interest in teaching. Teaches like no other prof. Challenges students to think, creates an interactive and dynamic learning environment, engages in mind blowing stimulating discussions.

I get A+ in every course but he gave me only A.", "Professor Min is an excellent Prof. I love him.", "Minoo is an excellent professor. His love for the subject is very admirable. He was always willing to help students out... even if it meant going out of his way. I spent many hours in his office and developed a much better understanding of the material as a result. Minoo is truly a genius and deserves a great deal of respect.", "I hated the course because Min-oo never explained well. He set unreasonable demands on students and was condescending and unhelpful whenever approached for help. He hates helping students.

Huge disappointment in the end.", "Extremely Boring. Turned me off the subject forever. After him, I don't think I'm intersted to take any more math courses. I got A's in first year math, but this prof does not how to teach. His handwriting is so bad!! I suggest people to take Math 2X03 instead of Math 2A03. Take 2X03 and 2XX3 so you can avoid Minoo", "Low quality lectures combined with hard exams and a poor attitude towards students created an all around bad learning experience. Taking minoo's math course is the last thing I would recommend someone in the world.", "This professor was horrible. He has low teaching ability and will make you hate the subject material. His lectures are so annoying and I most definitely donot recommend anyone to take a course taught by him.", "Minoo is my favourite professor. I LOVE HIM!!", "I completely agree. My math skills have been honed big time after taking his course. It has honed my problem solving ability. Taking his course will make you the next einstein!! He is that good.", "AMAZING Prof. If you are a serious math student who wants to HONE his/her problem solving skills, I strongly recommend you take a course taught by NONE OTHER THEN KENNETH MIN00. He will teach you how to think like a mathematician and hone your problem solving ability not just in math, but also in &quot;real life problems&quot;!!Brilliant prof. Very helpful!!", "He's an amazing prof and such a good helper for his students. He's always available to answer questions any time.

He's such a great prof.McMaster should be proud of him.", "He is very intelligent, so it is difficult for mediocre students to understand what he is teaching.

He's amazing. you enjoy math with him", "Extreeeemely helpful.Very nice guy and super smart. I really respect him.", "Prof Min-Oo is the best prof I've ever had at McmMaster he's very helpful and really wants us to learn the course material he's genius and very smart and maybe guys who complain here are just finding it hard to pass or to have a good grade so they blame the prof.

I am learnig a lot in his class.", "One of the only math profs at MAC who takes the time to understand and help his students.Great teacher and very approachable.teaching style is unique and motivating!Min-Oo is very open to questions and is a great prof to go to for quidance!would def recommend taking this course with him, a great experience!", "Dr. Minoo?s 3Z03 is probably the most practical class among other math courses. His class is not easy, yet gives you an opportunity to apply/use mathematics in real world. At the same time, many of his lectures make you think, not memorize formulas. I did not get a high mark but I think at least it gives me a different aspect of mathematics.", "I'd give him negative marks if possible. He does not deserve 1 out of 5 even. He is really that bad. Go Figure!!", "Dr. Min-Oo is very enthusiastic about the history of math and genuinely cares about his students.If you put in the effort you will be happy with the results.Receiving a bad mark is not a reflection of his teaching style but more of your dedication as a student.Very approachable prof and always willing to go the extra mile to help his students.", "Dr. Min-Oo is very interested in the topics covered in 3GP3 and it showed in every lecture. The homework was very challenging but he was always willing to give his students useful hints (for any problems - not just 3GP3!) both in and out of office hours. He inspired me to apply to graduate school for math to continue my education.", "This prof is totally WORTHLESS in all aspects. That one words sums up everything about his teaching and about him.", "Boring", "You're all just too used to being spoon fed. Min-Oo holds insightful lectures and connects the deeper aspects of the theory to their current use and significance in other areas of Math. and Physics.

My friends who took 3rd year history of math course with him have told me that he was the worst prof ever, who assigned grades based on whether he thinks you are a smart student and your overall impression on him. He is a terrible prof and he should be fired.", "he was so unfair", "Hilarious. I loved going to lecture with him, because everything seemed as if it were really exciting.... Not the best at clear explanations or organization. I learned everything from the textbook.", "The professor was always available during stated office hours and enjoyed the subject he was teaching. There was usually clear demarcation between knowledge that was required for tests/assignments and knowledge that was not. The only real flaw with this course was that there was no assigned textbook; this was the result of a departmental snafu.", "He hated me and gave me B even though I deserved A-", "I took 3Z03 with him and loved it.  He always talked about things that made math sound fascinating.  So I took 3GP3 thinking it would be fun, especially since the class had no physics prerequisites I was sure I could handle it since I took geometry.  Wrong!  Every lecture I had NO idea what was going on!  It was actually INSANE", "Prof has no teaching skills. He kills time by going off topic about various things irrelevant to the lecture. He thinks he's very smart and degrades his colleagues. He thinks he's a genius but he is not. His handwriting is so terrible!! Don't bother enrolling in any course taught by Min-oO", "Dr. Min-Oo tends to drift off the point too much, which obscured his oft-profound insights. He basically GAVE us the test questions beforehand, which is good for the grades, but I'm positive it's going to come back to haunt us all next semester. There's no doubt he's a brilliant man, but he's not much of a professor.", "Horrible prof, goes on tangents about irrelevant things.

Very smart and makes the students think like real mathematicains.", "WORSTEST prof ever...shame of the math department. Lowest quality professor of our math department. Feel sorry for all students who have to deal with this idiot. He's a complete tool. He talks to himself and mumbles. Doesn't have any teaching skills. Awful handwriting. Likes to get salary for free, without doing anything. Bad attitude prof.", "WORST TEACHER EVER! He doesn't even talk about math in lectures, he just complains about something random that he chooses for that day. It's horrible.. I've had 4 classes with him =(", "Be careful if you wanna take math 3z03 with him. Minoo will only give you a good grade if he liked you as a person. It doesn't matter whether your paper is good or not. Trust me on this one! This year Minoo decided he will not give A+ to anyone.  If you want to avoid a surprise mark avoid him! If he happens to like you, he will give you an A or A-", "I'm 99% sure he read the papers, just so you know.", "mean, unfair, goes of on random speeches that have nothing to do with the course but just feed his big ego. does more complaining than teaching.", "EXTREMELY UNFAIR MAN. GIVES GRADES WITHOUT ANY JUSTIFICATION. I CANT BELIEVE MCMASTER UNIVERSITY KEEPS THIS MAN EMPLOYED. A TOTAL DISGRACE TO OUR EDUCATION. MAUNG MIN-OO IS  A CERTIFIED LIAR.

Doesnot even have the courtesy to answer students emails. So lazy, rude, and lied to our class.", "He doesn't really know how to teach; really likes to talk and get all the attention. In the term he picks his favourite students, makes sure they get an A+.

ANALYSIS SHOULD WAIT TILL 3RD YEAR!", "Excellent class.... you made me love math again!", "Best Prof at Mac.", "Great guy but he just will not shut up! Easy tests, but his lectures are bizarre. They are comparable to going to watch a stand-up comedy act that is not that funny.

You can really tell he's knows what he's teaching and loves history. Honestly the textbook is a bit dense but if you good a lectures you don't have to read it. Plus he makes jokes sometimes and is really approachable. No way you wont love him", "Everyone likes him. Amazing lecturer!", "heathorn has such a soothing voice and accent that it makes it easy to fall asleep in class, but his interesting, well structured, hilarious, and useful lectures keep me awake. can't wait to take another course with this dude!! definitely hot in an old guy way", "Amazing course! Dr. Heathorn is one of the most helpful teachers and makes sure you understand the content. The assignments are hard but he always allows students to do well if you put in the work.

Definitely my favourite class of the semester.", "The classes were interesting and engaging. The depth of his knowledge on WWI was astounding obviously a close personal passion of his and this shows through in his lectures. Using some a great mix of both videos, pictures and songs.

and really take the time to understand the material, an 11 or 12 are very possible. His questions are usually not surprises however he may try to trick you so read carefully! He's really funny and gives great notes :)", "love him, hes funny and so helpful! If you ever email him, he responds so fast even though there are 800 other students in the same class. his notes are amazing, and super helpful! If you study his notes and practice tests you will do good in the course!", "HE IS SOO AMAZING. makes jokes during class and makes confusing concepts seem so simple! One of the best profs I've had", "Aaron Childs is one of the MOST thorough, articulate professors I've ever had. He is able to explain even the most confusing concepts with clarity and his course is designed to reinforce key concepts over and over again. From the repetition, plenty of examples and slow pace- you don't feel rushed in class to take notes. The mould for the perf prof!", "Funny guy.", "Childs taught the material very well  however he does not post notes so you must come to lecture to get the material.   Assignments and textbook work supplement the lectures", "Prof. Childs was an amazing instructor. He was able to explain many of the new concepts in the course effectively and was very clear in process during lecture. I really enjoyed my time in his class. However, missing lectures is not really worth it as he doesn't post his notes. But there were quite a few destroyers on that exam, so know your stuff.", "Dr. Childs was the most amazing and hilarious professor. His teaching style is exceptional. The Assignments were very helpful for tests. His notes are clear, concise and easy to understand-- no textbook needed to understand content. His midterms and exams were very doable without problems if you try all the provided practice tests. A definite 12.", "Childs is probably the best teacher I have ever had. He essentially writes out your note with you during lecture -at pace you can follow- while explaining what it all means. The assignments are helpful and the tests are fair. If you learn the info and do the practice tests this course is a guaranteed A. Also wow so funny", "great prof", "Made a dry course fun with his jokes. Go to class, take notes, and do the practice problems and you should do fine.", "He is amazing!!!!!! Very clear explanations, just practice all in class examples and assignment examples and you are golden for the exam! Dr. Childs is very helpful during office hours as well. TA's were fantastic.", "He's the best 3", "Dr. Childs was my favourite professor first year. If he wasn't a prof he would probably be a comedian.", "First midterm was fair. Second midterm was full of tricks. Exam was definitely a bit too long for the given amount of time. Having taken Math 1A03 and Stats 2B03 with him, I can say that he definitely taught 2B03 much better. I feel that this course did not need much understanding so long as you were good at math.", "Childs uses humor to keep his lectures relatively full of students. His notes are very well organized, so if you take the time to go over all his examples you will definitely understand all of the material. He gives you plenty of practice questions prior to a midterm or exam, so if you practice then you will be satisfied with your final grade.", "makes subtle yet hilarious jokes about math that gets the entire lecture hall laughing. By the end of the term the classroom was FULL every day with people ditching their other sections to come to Aarons.", "He has some sense of humorous", "Hilarious. Can't wait to have it again. The course is really not that hard as long as you keep up and do homework questions. Not many surprises on tests. ", "Funny, good, prof. He knows the course content like non other and does exceptionally well in answering questions. Teaches at a decent pace, sometimes too fast but I guess it is expected since there is a lot to cover.", "He was pretty funny, but really intimidating. No one would ask questions in his class because he would really make people feel bad! People were clearly struggling. For me the lectures weren't really helpful, and the exams ended up being really tricky ! If you aren't into his teaching, do every single homework question. Fall behind and you'll fail!", "Very straightforward professor. Do the practice tests and go to lectures and you'll be good!", "Aaron Childs is a usual professor. He taught out of the text book, however - his notes were almost verbatim from the text book and so there was a lot of writing to do in class. He is hilarious, but often unintentionally. Assignments were annoying because they were online, but tests were quite easy. Very straightforward.", "good teacher. tough course", "Everyone seems to like him for some reason. I don't find his joke funny. His explanations are cloudy and unclear. Some are long and tedious when there are better methods to doing things. Does not do math using a pure math way, but then again he did his BSc, MSc and PhD in math at McMaster, so I guess it's expected.", "Awesome professor. He's super clear with concepts and answers any questions in class, and really well too. His jokes are hilarious and always relevant. Best first year professor I've had without at doubt. Made math an enjoyable experience.", "Dr.Childs is a great prof, his tests are really easy.", "I loved this prof. Straightforward but that's what was great....Thorough explanations at perfect pace, constantly held review sessions, answered questions eagerly, tests were fair but still university level.He isnt necessarily too exciting but I am taking a class from him not trying to friends ;) Take a course with him!", "Childs is a very strange man. He tells the same jokes every year (his dad is Venn, and his fish is Poisson). At first it's funny, then you're kind of concerned for him. Great teacher though. Very thorough in explanations and helpful. Does review periods before tests, and tests are very similar to practice tests he posts. Very fair!", "The absolute best prof I had in first year. I skipped all of Dr.Baker's classes and went to his instead. Actually liked this course and found it easier than 1A03 because of this man. Funny. Clear. Helpful. Can't ask more for better math prof.", "i died in his class. died laughing. he's too funny. material is not easy but he makes them clear, and makes the test easy.", "Good prof. Has a good sense of humor but I hated the fact that he taught straight out of the textbook.", "Dr. Childs is my favourite professor at McMaster. He is very good at explaning the course material, and his notes are clear and easy to follow. He speaks very clearly and does not rush while writing notes. He is also absolutely hilarious. Making jokes during every class made me actually want to go to class! Such a boss!", "Great prof. He goes over the material so slowly and he writes SO SO slowly that you actually want to sleep in class but nonetheless he was an amazing math prof!", "Best first year eng teacher! Extremely clear and his notes are amazing. His tests are very fair and always similar to the practice questions. Very funny as well!", "Dr. Childs is an excellent teacher.  He has the ability to make complex material seem quite clear.  He always says that the material is incredibly hard, but this is just a tactic to make people work harder.", "Anyone saying Childs is a poor teacher doesnt pay attention in class. He has excellent lecture notes and his tests were hard at times, but always fair! Favourite prof from first year eng!!!", "very good teacher but he does not want any1 to pass and loves to see people fail.", "Dr. Childs is one of the best teachers I've had. He is extremely funny, explains concepts well, and is a really nice guy :)", "great prof, great sense of humor and fair tests", "He was the worst professor I have had in first year engineering. Decent in explaining...but very unflexible and very unhelpful...when you need him.", "Awesome teacher, he know how to explain in simple way.", ":)", "Good prof, but as the head of the engineering math sections he schedules the date/time for all the tests.  every single one of the tests we had this year was on a friday night at 9:30pm, we even had a test on thanksgiving friday.  after much complaint from students and the faculty he still wouldn't consider changing any of the times.", "The guy is awesome, has a great sense of humor, explains the material like no one else, although the material is hard but he made so simple, answered questions clearly, usually provides hard sample exams and solves the majority of them but the real exam is away easier. This is how a real teacher should be", "An excellent prof; has review sessions every friday and on the days before tests; class consisted of lectures only; labs are generally easy; will answer any question you have during class; a good sense of humour; and a nice guy all around.", "Teaches important lesson in the shortest and efficient way possible. Never waste time. Probably the best professor in Mcmaster.", "Dr.childs is an amazing professor. He knows how do easily teach new material to student.", "I honestly don't know what you people are complaining about... Childs explained things with extreme clarity and just didn't want to put up with students' bull. Everyone complaining here seems to be the whiney, marks-oriented, &quot;cry to mommy and daddy&quot; type. Just because you couldn't pass the course the way intended is not the prof's problem.", "I don't know what all the bad comments are about. I didn't meet a single person in first year whose favourite math prof was not Childs. His tests aren't hard either, I have no idea what people are talking about.", "Everyone seems torn on this guy.  I like him, he's funny, covers the material very carefully and is incredibly methoidic.  People either hate him or love him so try him out! don't bash him cause you failed math!", "Best Prof for first year engineering for sure. Lectures are a must go. At the end everyone was going to his lectures instead of the other profs. However, beginning material (for 1Z04) can sneak up on people, class average wasn't that good but was bell curved in the end. Definatly choose Childs at the beginning as it will fill up fast.", "He is a mean person with so much attitude. He never considers any alternative grading schemes and on his web site under the FAQ section he responds with an emphatic NO to every question. Such a conceited person.", "he is really nice guy.Also lot helpful on the exam day in review session", "I hope that his own children (his biological children that is) fail in University when they become big and attend post secondary institution. Then he will feel the pain that he inflicts on students. He writes unfair exams (all MCQ for a math course) because he is lazy and does not want to hand mark the long answer problems. What a l000zer.", "I agree to the latest comment. He is really not a doctor. His main hobby is failing students and getting happy after that. What a sad prof. I hope his kids fail in University when they become big then he will know what it's like to give grief to first year engineers.", "I don't know what some of these people are talking about... Childs is amazing! He is very good at explaining things in lectures. And he can be really funny too, makes coming to class semi-worthwhile. And I'm obviously not the only one who liked Childs, for the first few weeks, his class was extremely overcrowded (aisles were even packed with people", "By Far the worst professor ever. He gives multiple choice questions on exams because he is too lazy to get them hand marked. Multiple choice is really bad, because you either get it right or wrong, and no part marks. This prof is HORRENDOUS at teaching. He makes extremely dumb jokes and is good for nothing else. The man is ultra-worthless. AWFUL!!!", "He made so many mathematical mistakes during lectures. Do you call that a math genius&#63; Not even close. Don't take any course with this prof.", "Good notes, entertaining lectures - he's the man. Honestly, he's so funny I wish I had him for my other courses.", "I'm in first year Engineering. He is an amazing prof,  one of the best the math department. He has good pacing of the material and explains very well. His class is always full for the first week or 2 of the semester, but only until people start dropping out, which is a common thing in Engineering :P", "The BEST PROF in my 1st yr Engineering program. If I were not in his class, I don't think that I can get &quot;A&quot;. I love U SIR, &quot;ONE MARK&quot;!!!", "I've never had him personally but i heard hes an AWESOME teacher.  Too bad his classes are always full.", "he is the best prof for math......", "The course evaluation is not negotiable i.e. Individual requests for alternative weightings will NEVER be considered.", "I saw him or someone who looked exactly like him at Solid Gold few days back. He looked very happy. THE COURSE EVALUATION IS NOT NEGOTIABLE. IE. INDIVIDUAL REQUESTS FOR ALTERNATIVE WEIGHTINGS WILL NEVER BE CONSIDERED.", "he is the one of the best teacher i have ever had..n definitely THE BEST for math..for 1Z04 i didnt go to most of my class..but in childs class now u actually feel like going cz FINALLY I UNDERSTAND SOMETHING..HE ROCKS!!", "Very arrogant prof. He thinks he is KING of the math department. Please. He's more like KING OF THE TOILET. So far my worst experience at Mac was having this guy as a prof.", "Best Math Teacher at Mac!!", "His lectures match his name: childish.", "We just called it my dad's rule. Childs is the most popular first-year Eng prof, and for good reason. He knows what he's talking about and answers people's questions well. You'll like him even better if you an appreciate his odd sense of humour. I've fallen asleep in almost every class, but Childs manages to keep Calc interesting every lecture.", "He keeps a large collection of Rocco movies in his office.", "He was the worst among all profs I had in Fall 2006 when I took his Stats 3D03. He was so bad I don't even have words to explain how terrible his teaching methods were. Please avoid this prof for any course.", "Notes are very helpful. I didn't even have to buy the textbook. Did very well in the course just using the notes. Sometimes says awkward things.. but overall great teacher! PS I liked Canty, but to say that Canty's more knowledgeable and passionate is def false. Childs LOVES stats, know much more.", "this guy is a good prof.   he sticks to his timeline and makes some pretty good jokes.  He is easy to understand.", "Compared to Canty, this prof was nothing. Canty is the stats genius and the most fair stats prof ever. Canty's knowledge and unparalleled enthusiasm in the classroom makes Aaron childs look like a small 'child'", "I had him in Fall 2006 for stats 3D03 he was really tough for that course as well. His Assignments were brutal and worth only 15%", "This guy is really the worst prof EVER. He is incredibly stern arrogant and unforgiving with regards to the course policies. Highly Inflexible and he's got a major attitude issue. Annoying voice too. Try to avoid him if at all possible. He is apparently a specialist only in first yr calculus, teach uper year courses, then we'll know if you're smart", "Best professor in the math department (at least for Engineering). In addition to his excellent teaching ability, he also has a great sense of humour.", "Awesome prof! Great explanations, always willing to answer students' questions and he's hilarious during lectures :)", "HE IS VERY TOUGH PROFESSOR I RECOMMEND U SWITCH TO DR.CANTY SECTION HE IS THE BEST OF ALL STATISTIC PROFESSORS", "Easy to understand, good examples.

Extremely anti-social outside of lecture though...", "The voice bugged me...but hes a good teacher", "He was a very good teacher. He made jokes when he knew that we all needed a laugh to keep from crying at the complexity of the problem. All in all a very good teacher. Best yet!", "Childs is a sweet prof. Makes us laugh, AND understand maths :)", "omg hes such an ass but an amazing professor the &quot;i just realized you guys have the most courses and the hardest courses! i guess that means when youre done you will be really good engineers... all FOUR of you!&quot; kills me, when i cant get into my lecture bcuz everyone else comes to my class since their profs suck kinda makes me mad tho", "Best prof I have ever seen. If he is teaching stats3d03 you need to take the course immediately. He is really fair and not tough.", "The best prof! Very loud, nasal voice (doesn't use a mic) and huge, clear printing on the board. Although he seemed to be arrogant, he's actually a really nice man. Funny guy too, with a few corny jokes up his sleeve. Points out people who sleep in class. Answers questions patiently and clearly, no matter how difficult. Tests weren't hard at all.", "Very good prof. If you failed a course that's your problem.  All profs have certain rules they have to follow and if on top of raising everyone's mark you still fail the course then it's kind of too bad. You didn't deserve to pass.", "a great prof, makes everything clear and easy to understand.  If you do your work you are guaranteed a good mark, it's not even hard either ...if you go to his lectures because he explains everything so well(calc and algebra).", "I think it's unfair to judge him based on his policy of &quot;not considering individual requests for alternative weightings&quot; I mean that's a rule that pretty much every prof has, and the reason why he puts it under &quot;post exam FAQ&quot; is because engineers will never understand unless he makes it crystal clear. He's an excellent prof & a very sweet person.", "you MUST attend class and take awesome notes because for both courses I took with him I'd skip class and try to get by with the textbook and ended up with a D+ in both courses. he gives everything in the notes. very clear. wont trick u. he repeats same jokes every year and they're cheezy but still funny", "very good", "After exams he posts a 'post exam FAQ' list indicating that if you ask him to increase your mark by one point for whatever reason, he's just not going to do it, no matter how badly you need it. That displays how unhelpful this guy is. Don't know why people give him good ratings.", "OK he is very helpful (being sarcastic) because he always says this &quot;The course evaluation is NOT negotiable. i.e., individual requests for alternative weightings will NEVER be considered&quot; I think he deserves less than 0 for helpfulness", "excellent, funny prof. keeps stats interesting. tests are pretty easy if you study. no problems here.", "just too good! and he makes fun of science kids", "Very clear with tons of examples (that actually help when the test comes!)

Excellent coverage of the material, although a little non-chalant", "Best prof ever.  If you go to his algebra class 3 mins late, prolly u have to sit on the stairs or floor, b'cuz pp dont go to other classes and come to our class.  If u get his notes. Just redo them before u take test( if u dont have the time to do all suggested problems).  This is is the only 2 classes i feel reluctant to skip.", "The BEST Level 1 Prof in Engineering by far! He's extremley clear and his notes complement the textbook EXTREMLEY well. His jokes are acutally quite funny and keeps you interested in learning.", "What can I say about Dr. Childs&#63; He's the BEST math prof at MAC. SERIOUSLY. He knows the stuff by heart, and more importantly he can TEACH it! I don't know what this subtely condescending crap is about! GOD PPL he jokes around so u don't FALL ASLEEP!

Makes math class extreamly enjoyable.", "good prof.. he sounds like Big Bird.. listen for it next time you hear him talk.. lol", "Great prof! Very clear lessons, easy to take notes, comfortable atmosphere.

If you do not have a good understanding of biology, physics, and chemistry, this course is a huge challenge.", "This class has a lot of material, but it was very interesting. Dr. Goldreich demonstrated applications for every topic that made class more engaging and made the information easier to understand and remember. He really tests your understanding, not just memorization. High quality professor - I learned a lot.", "Course material was interesting, and Dr. Goldreich was engaging in lectures, but the testing for this course was rather unfair and not representative of the material learned.  Personally, I wish I had taken 2N03 instead.", "Took the class a few years ago, TA'ed it last year. Dan is a good prof, wants you to learn. Great course for anyone genuinely interested in neuroscience. Assignments/in-class are relatively free marks. Tests are relatively harder than many profs, make you think, but fine if you know it and are a critical thinker. note: He loves math, as you'll see.", "Content was really interesting and testing was always fair. It's hard to keep a three hour neuroscience class engaging but there was never once a boring class. You can tell he puts a lot of thought and effort into his tests and his assignments.", "Interesting course! His course is three hours, but never lets the class early - I am not complaining though.  It is obvious he loves the materials and teaching - very engaged with the course and students. Extremly friendly and helpful. His teaching style is absolutely great, i mean it is a lot of work to take his course, but it is worth it!", "Awesome Prof. He's a cool prof and is pretty easy with his marking as well. Overall I think he turned what's not necessarily the most interesting subject (neuroscience) into a pretty enjoyable course. Would definitely recommend.", "He's always willing to help students and is quite enthusiastic. Very approachable, and is able to keep me awake even for the three hour class with his interspersed class interaction and brain teasers--great teaching method =).", "very inspiring!!! just amazing. his tests are not easy, but fair", "WOW! He is a phenomenal professor. You really need to attend class, but its never a hassle. I always skip my other classes - but will never skip a class of his. He keeps the class motivated and laughing and really gets you interested in what you are learning because you can tell he LOVES it! Would never hesitate to take a clss with him!", "Great prof. Very clear, very enthuastic, And very very very helpful. A nice guy too. To excel in class, just attend his lectures and read his notes. Also, remember any number he says...he loves numbers and they appear on tests.", "One of the kindest, most patient and cheerful profressor I've come across. He's an AWESOME addition to the faculty, and a great lecturer too! He makes the morning classes something to actually look forward too, even if his jokes are a bit lame (but still funny!) :) I'm glad I was in his class!", "Such an intelligent man. He was so cheerful at 830am. One can learn so much just by talking to him.

cornerstone of the physics department. He loves the subject and really wants his students to succeed. However, his classes are by no means easy. You have to definitely be willing to put in work to do well. He expects you to read ahead and do homework that in addition to the labs and Loncapa take up a lot of time.", "Cares about the class", "caring prof that you can tell he truly wants you to succeed. Although lectures are hard to follow along, and when you try to go home and read them online, none of the questions have any solutions to them. tests were very difficult and multiple choice was impossible. wouldnt really recommend as a prof,but seehim in his office hours is really helpful", "Nejat was a legendary prof to have his random in-class pop quizzes kept everyone on their toes, but you could tell that he really did care that his students succeed and inspired us to a high standard.", "His accent is really hard to understand. He rushes through the whole lecture and only gives a minute to solve questions that would take at least  5 minutes to solve. Therefore, You end up understanding nothing. I studied off youtube for the whole course and my grade wasn't too bad. The only reason I went to lectures was for the iclicker questions.", "Studied for his class more than any other ENG1 course yet barely passed... the way he taught was confusing and learning on your own from his slides is very hard because of the way the slides are. Also puts important questions in lectures but doesn't provide a solution to them. Wouldn't recommend", "Physics 1E03 : Introduction to life choices and lessons xD. Honestly Nejat is one of the best profs you can have for year one Engineering.", "\"Find your knowns, find your unknows, the rest is math, and do you want a microphone?\" are what you're gonna hear from Dr. Nejat. Dr. Nejat is easily the best physics a prof a student can have who really cares with all his heart that we learn and do well in exams. Really accessible outside class and appreciates it when someone works hard.", "Great prof! His classes are quite entertaining and engaging. You won't ever dreadfully stare at a clock waiting for his class to be over. He's funny, passionate about physics, and good at explaining concepts. He picks on people to answer questions so be prepared for that!! It's great that he does that, makes you pay attention.", "Dr. Nejat is an incredible professor. He is inspiring not only for physics but also for life and dreams.", "Given the complex nature of the nuclear physics, his explanations were very clear but missing depth. Nejat is an amazing professor and a human; very friendly, doesn't try to avoid you, and reasonable.  I respect him a lot.", "I go everyday to watch him say the words \"and the rest is math\"", "His accent and very interactive teaching style take some time to get used to, but you can tell he wants you to succeed in his class.  Labs were meh.....", "ONE MINUTE READ, ONE MINUTE ANSWER - proceeds to allow 2-3 minutes for iclicker answers while hovering over the end poll button in anticipation.", "Great professor. Lectures are hilarious and usefull. Test are quite tough,  but if you do the wrong,  they're not impossible. 10/10 would take a class with him anyday", "\"Draw Free Body Diagram\", \"Next by you\" are only a few of his catchphrases that I will miss from this class. He really engages the students and tries to make the lectures funny and less intimidating. Enter his class you would not only learn physics but just life in general. Awesome prof. Try to have physics class with him as much as possible. ", "Really knows what he's talking about, and really loves teaching. I looked forward to going to class.", "Hi All (C05, C06)  Nejat was my favourite prof in first year. He was always so caring and so genuine, and so helpful in office hours. I'm honestly going to miss sitting in ABB 102 and having Nejat teach me physics. Even though the course was hard, he did a great job.  Bottom line, he's an awesome professor and an even better human being.   OK!", "Very caring professor who genuinely cares for his students to do well in the course", "Never met a professor like him. Coming to uni, I had some difficulties and he changed my opinion of what it means to be taught by someone who cares. He has the biggest heart, and has been almost a father figure to me. Always willing to help, he will go the extra mile to make sure you understand, and does anything he can to help--with anything.", "his mustache gives you a better understanding of Newton's laws.", "You have to go to class because of the iClickers, useless prof who thinks that if he yells at you enough it will make it through your thick skull", "This professor is very rude in my opinion. Very unapproachable. Luckily, this was just an elective; unfortunately, it was a waste of money.", "Amazing Prof! He loves to engage the class and picks on people but it enhances the classes learning! The best physics prof hands down! Definitely recommended as he prepares you the most for the brutal midterm and exam!", "Very helpful", "Dr. Nejat gets a lot of flak, but I think most of that is misplaced frustration with the course itself. Physics is not easy by any stretch of the imagination, and it takes a lot of self-directed learning to get a good mark in this class. That being said, Dr. Nejat is always willing to help, and does his best to clarify even the most trivial issues.", "Hard to understand him, he makes mistakes in lectures and expects you to be a lecture ahead with loncapa and quizzes. Not a fan.", "Extremely difficult to understand in class. Asks questions before teaching concepts. I had a really hard time in this course not taking physics in high school. He is a very nice man though, if you go to office hours, you may not learn more, but he will help you with your grades.", "Very helpful! Love him! I think he is the a very responsible prof.", "Recommend dropping this course if you have him. Goes through useless material and is reluctant to help students.", "useless.", "He was a good prof! He def loves teaching n wants his students to get the best. I took physics 1L03 n got a good mark in his class :) He is very help, although indeed he does speak funny and unclear sometimes", "Nejat's a champ", "very attentive.. realizes that in this course most people either hate or have trouble with physics so he tries and effectively makes the class interesting... 'oh that's a good one!'", "Coming into this course without any background in physics proved to be quite challenging; this course is not as much of a bird as everyone says it was and it was in fact my lowest mark this year.", "his english is bad, he talks funny and he is so boring.", "I am not a fan of phsyics at all..in fact i hate it but this prof made me actually want to come to class and learn it..hes good at what he does and his tests are fair!", "He is very interesting and funny.", "Nice guy, funny, engages the students and does his best to make it easy without insulting your intelligence. My favorite prof this semester :)", "Funny man, but not very clear as a teacher and not very good at answering questions and helping people to better understand the content.", "only class where i learnt shat and still managed to get a decent grade.", "Had him for engphy 2d03. He made it hard and interesting at the same time. Really enjoys forcing you to think", "Good prof. loves to grab students out of the audience to answer questions. some accent difficulties. slight organizational issues with regards to capa", "Great professor, funny guy, and loves his students.", "A very enthusiastic and caring professor. Assignments are helpful, tests challenging, exam quite easy. I think more focus on assigning selected homework problems rather than &quot;just do the ones in your book&quot; would have been helpful. He really loves his students and loves teaching.", "Very enthusiastic and willing to help, but can be very unclear. Weekly assignments are relatively helpful but tedious. Participate in his class and he'll love you.", "I love him! &quot;GO AHEAD!!&quot; &quot;Hello guys!&quot;", "Great Prof. Has high expectations of students, but does everything imaginable to help you attain his high standards. Extremely approachable and helpful, good sense of humor and friendly. Highly suggest taking his classes. A+ for Nejat", "Funny dude, fully did a pendulum trial in class and nearly got knocked down by the flying pendulum. Picks on random people in class, and gets disappointed if low test avg for his class. Do your work every night and he'll be impressed!", "Quite simply he is just my favorite professor this semester.", "Best professor at McMaster. I got an A- in his class and most of the credit goes to his friendly teaching skills. His demeanor is very simple and that makes it really easy to approach him. He helps students a lot, makes photocopies of exercise sheets for students, post solutions promptly, has a clear voice and very interactive.", "I absolutely love this guy. He's such a little cute old man with the funniest accent ever. He likes to single people out so sit in the front to avoid be asked questions. Rather than lecturing he prefers to lead class discussions which is very helpful. If you go to his office hours he is very helpful, he helped me the day of the exam and I did super", "A good prof, definitely keeps you paying attention otherwise he will ask you a question.  One of the few classes that I liked.", "Dr Nejat is awesome!  I never really like physics, but he made it interesting, fun and easy enough for me to take both semesters!  He's so kind, and really cares about students.  He makes university courses feel like high school again - class interaction and compassion for students!\r \r &quot;Please turn off your cell phones, nobody wants to dance now!&quot;", "If you somehow land in his class, quickly try to transfer into Hughes'.  He is sweet but he doesn't take the time to answer questions slowly and clearly and he wastes too much time asking people if they've done their work.  The english is a little problem too!", "The proboblity of Lyowder!", "Communicates ideas very well, with a lot of useful analogies. Tests are reasonable. Very nice to students, he printed about 30 pgs of notes for not being able to find it on the website.", "fantastic instructor a fan favorite but also serious at the same time.  He will help no matter what he is doing at the time but also brings the material to life.  He points and asks people questions but that is to get people involved and never done with malice.  Best class I have had at mac and best prof.", "Animated teaching style and frequent class interaction definately keep your attention focused on the material.  Goes out of his way to explain things for the art students who mistakenly applied to science. &lt;evilgrin&gt;", "Best Physics prof!", "An awesome prof. Very understanding and encouraging. Tries to help poor students in spite of them clearly not having read material. Underappreciated many of his students", "He is just great", "If you are not very good at physics, he is the guy for you! He makes you understand! But if you do have some insight into physics, you might get bored in his lectures!", "Very good prof. Tries to help poor students in spite of them clearly not having read material. His lectures highlight the shortcomings of only understanding application. Very helpful as he shows hidden relationships in physics. Underappreciated because majority of his students are stupid and lazy.", "Very good prof. He gets the class involved in most of his lectures and is very helpful if you don't understand something. He also cares for his students, one example is he changed a test date because he knew that we had 4 other tests in that week.", "He's a love or hate kinda guy, and I think he's great. Got me to understand and appreciate basic physics much more thoroughly than in high school. And he's really helpful if you want a recommendation letter or some extra help. Volunteer in class, too.", "It might seem like he's picking on you when he singles you out, but don't take it personally - he just wants to get everyone involved.  Very effective as a teacher.  Taking his class even helped with understanding other classes.", "Not only did he explain the physics really well, he also taught us the necessary math months before we learned it in our math class, and did a better job of it than the math prof. He absolutely loves to talk to students (for hours if you go to his office)", "Please class, have a discussion, I've never been picked on so much in a class in my life. Although he's really smart, he needs to understand that we're really not.", "He totally reminds me of Saddam Hussain...in a good way. For the first time ever, I dont sleep in Physics class....he really sticks his face in yours to get an answer...makes you think", "Terrible.  I saw him yell at a student for not knowing the answer to the question &quot;what is force&#63;&quot;  If you've got him for 1E3 - attend a different lecture.  Having the word element screamed over and over won't help you understand area integr", "I have no idea what he was saying. Tests were tough and exam was easy, but it didn't really test understanding.  Marking made no sense and he was uncooperative regarding a remark.", "Extremely enthusiastic, interacts with the class and explains concepts better than any prof I've had. He taught us differential equations so well we asked him to come teach our math class! Best prof ever!", "Dr. Nejat is great!  He makes difficult concepts easy to understand.  He loves to teach and it helps you learn more.", "This dude would tower above all profs if he was not ESL.  His enthusiasm is contagious.  He loves to teach.  Don\u2019t be scared of his interactive style.  Once you realize there is no shame in not knowing the answers to one of his on-the-spot questions, you", "Great Prof! Enthusiastic and cares for his students! Full of energy and knowledge. Might be a little hard to understand but is still one of the best proffs at Mac :)", "A lot of fun. He WANTS you to learn and understand his passion, PHYSICS!", "This man loves his physics!  So intense, but so good....

That was probably so people who showed up to lecture got a free mark. Additionally, you get iClicker points if you show up to the lecture and answer the multiple choice questions, which can be used to drop lowest quiz grades", "Amazing professor, ver well structured course, would definitely take it again", "Course too heavy on quizzes and not much else. Could be done online.", "Dr Kim was an amazing prof, and especially in first year where you're not used to big lectures and professors. His lectures are very interesting and engaging and the quizzes and exam were very reasonable.", "Most structured course in McMaster University. He has everything organized to make you succeed. Watch 30 min module before monday lecture (make notes if you can). Go to tutorial to practice what you've learned. TAs are the most trained charismatic TA's at McMaster. Then do the online quiz on friday with your buddies. Impossible to do poorly.", "Joe Kim does everything he can to help you succeed. The course is really relevant and well structured. Just take advantage of the practice quizzes and you'll be fine.", "i loved joe kims lectures, he did a good job of keeping the class engaged and i found the material of the course itself (both in the modules and in class) to be really interesting. this was definitely my favourite course of the semester and joe kim was easily my favourite prof of first year", "He needs to spend more time listening to other views. He is busy telling people only what he knows.", "Dr. Kim is a great professor. The only complaint I have about this class is that it is unclear which material you are supposed to know from the textbook, as sometimes new information that is not brought up in lecture or the web modules is found in the text, rather than supplementing what was already learned. Also, you should be prepared to study.", "Have weekly quiz and you need to study for it. Need to study before the tutorial.", "Joe Kim's lectures were sometimes a bit off topic, but were still a lot of fun.  The tutorials were especially useful since they were a chance to gain a further understanding of material from lecture and online modules.  Lecture attendance is important since iclicker points can be used to drop low grades.  Highly recommend this course and prof.", "I LOVE DR KIM, he genuinely tries his best to make lectures as interesting as possible. Weekly quizzes aren't easy but they're not impossible either. The only thing I didn't like was how the exam was worth so much, but it was alright at the end because other marks are fairly easy to get if you try your best. I'm looking forward to Psych 1XX3!", "Overall, I enjoyed the content of PSYCH 1X03 but Joe Kim isn't by any means my favorite professor. Lectures were entertaining (and his daughter gives me life) but the content felt thrown together and ended up being almost completely unnecessary for the final. Textbook pretty much optional as well. 30% quizzes, 10% tutorial, 50%-55% final.", "he real cute", "Worst class I have ever taken!!! The lectures and tutorials are useless and the course coordinator and prof is no help. A waste of time and stress, definitely do not recommend, I'm never taking psychology again.", "If you are taking this class as an elective, don't. The weekly quizzes are tricky and tough, and the exam content had the same level of difficulty. Attending lecture should be done, since there are iclicker points that you can obtain and a certain amount will drop your lowest participation grade/ quiz grade. The tutorials were very helpful.", "If it is a core course to you. Just go for it. But if you are taking it as an elective. Dont bother to do so. The benefit of the course is there is no midterm but every friday quizzes. When it comes to exam, the questions are so tricky that it is unlike your quizzes questions. And basically you wont have time for a such a  ' time wasting' elective", "Joe Kim makes the lectures easy to listen to and the grading of the course is fair. There is lots of room for extra credits, including extra participation marks which help you to drop your lowest marks on the quizzes at the end of the semester. He also offers SONA experiments that can be done to lower the stakes of the exam from a 55% to 50% exam.", "Good course, he's definitely not a prof to be afraid of. This course is not an easy 12 by any means though; the questions on the tests can be quite ambiguous.", "Joe Kim is one of a kind. His online modules are littered with hit or miss jokes, as are his in class lectures. His tests can be difficult if you don't read the textbook and practice using his online quizzes. He seems to care a lot about his students, but don't let the relaxed atmosphere fool you, you'll need to put in the work to get a good grade.", "hes awesome", "Amazing Prof", "Too much content in the modules and does not clarify module information during lectures which is what is actually tested on the exam.   Only goes off tangents from actual material.  Ambiguous quizzes and poorly written textbook (probably by himself). WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.", "you can never feel not interested during his lecture", "Not great. He's a joke. Lectures don't really cover much material, and he doesn't bother posting the slides before the lecture.", "Great Lecturer, makes lectures engaging and interesting. Majority of the course is based on 10 Quizzes worth 3% each and final exam worth up too 55%. Questions are designed in a rather difficult way, which requires a keen understanding of the course material.", "Joe Kim is my fave, gets you involved and thinking. MC can be tricky but you'll do well if you attend lectures & read textbook (semi optional)", "Makes lectures fun, great course structure, his TA's are well trained and very accessible... Overall, WOULD REALLY RECOMMEND HIM & THE COURSE!!", "Unless you already know everything beforehand, expect to be completely puzzled by his 'expertise' on Neuroscience. I was so disappointed by his teaching methods which were so dry and incomprehensible that I switched my major. He gets a D- for that", "Great prof", "Questions on quizzes and exam are somewhat unclear. Assigned textbook for the course sometimes contradicts information for web modules and in-class lecture. Material is generally interesting but also vague, making quizzes hard. Only did well because I took psychology in high school.", "Tip: Doing the quizzes by yourself/without looking at your notes will do wonders for you when it comes to the final exam.", "He is hilarious! Psych 1X03 and 1XX3 were my favourite courses in first year. His lectures are very interesting and doesn't just reiterate the online modules. I have definitely never fallen asleep during his lectures--he's the best!", "Questions were ambiguous. Course was not written well and vague interpretations. Teach research that they are not even sure of. Psychology is not a science and should not be taught as such.", "I never read the textbook once and still did great! However, on the quizzes there are questions from the textbook, but if you have a textbook handy, it shouldn't take that long to find the answer. I also don't think the exam covered anything from the textbook. So mostly focus on the modules and lectures.", "Dr. Kim is an all around great prof. He really loves what he teaches and it shows during lectures. He makes the content fun to learn, and I rarely find myself zoned out during lectures. I would definitely take this class again.", "Always take really good notes. Didn't really read a lot of the textbook but when I did it was 100% helpful and goes in depth and over a lot of topics - because there is concepts/theories that you learn that isn't in the module or lecture that is super important! The Exam was fair and just like the weekly quizzes format wise. ", "Dr. Kim is hands down my favourite professor. The material in lectures, modules, and tutorials is all connected which allows for deep understanding of the concepts. His lectures are interactive, fun, and absolutely fly by. It is obvious that he is very passionate about his field and even though Psych is a huge  course he cares about his students.", " you do need some deeper level of thinking when it comes to the content/weekly quizzes. you'll be tested on stuff beyond what you learned (you have to know more than what was said in the module/lecture)... you're expected to know it thoroughly even if that's not how it was taught. the bonus points for iclickers are extremely helpful and generous", "1-His daughter is adorable 2-It is NOT a bird course. I am in medical radiation sciences and this is my lowest grade (80-83%)  3-weekly quizzes are very tricky and require you to be 100% comfortable with the material  4-Lectures aren't boring since he is funny and usually entertains us  5-Tutorials are mandatory and a BIG help", "Have to watch weekly 30 min web modules that are kind of boring sometimes, and there are weekly quizzes which have tricky questions. If you pay attention and take good web-module notes, you will do fine on the quizzes. Overall, I enjoy the class", "he uses his daughter as an example sometimes and its adorable. The lectures are interesting. He does a good job of keeping me focus. Lots of discussion with others around us though. ", "Interesting concepts are taught but overall a very difficult course with hard weekly quizzes that are timed. Do not take this course unless you are required to or are majoring in psych. Be prepared for a lot of readings and spending hours watching the modules. ", "He was an okay guy- he had some humour in the online course, but he was all around pretty bland. I was rather bored by his lectures, and his tests were incredibly tough. 60% for the final, unless you do some extra stuff. Multiple choice. If you're taking this for an elective, you better be amazing at trick multi-choice. Otherwise, don't.", "Awesome prof! Lectures were hilarious and unique. He explained things really well. Keep up on the textbook stuff because he asks a lot of questions about them. The exams are pretty tough and specific but if you understand the concepts you should do well. ", "i LOVED THE COURSE MATERIAL AND THE SUBJECT. BUT THEN THE EXAM COMES WORTH 55 PERCENT AND YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WASTED ALL YOUR TIME STUDYING FOR NOTHING BECAUSE THE QUESTIONS ARE SO HARD AND EVERYTHING SEEMS LIKE ITS THE RIGHT ANSWER. I WOULD NEVER TAKE HIS COURSE AGAIN.", "Psych 1XX3 is much easier than 1X03, but it isn't a bird course. The last 2 units were from the textbook so it's worth it to invest. Weekly quizzes with some questions taken from live lecture. Don't fall behind with the modules even though they're online and do the SONA studies. No midterm. The exam was more than fair.", "The set up of the course is a little weird, with an exam worth 60% and the rest from weekly quizzes and participation, but apart from that he's a great prof with amazing lectures. The overall content of the course is really interesting but his lectures made everything more relatable and easier to understand. Would take the course again, not doubt. ", "Dr. Kim was always clear and concise in his explanations on the online modules. His quiz questions were challenging, but when done in a group and efficiently greatly helped in applying and understanding the concepts! Exam questions were not as hard as the quiz questions, and were fair. Great Prof, would love to have him again!!! ", "I haven't seen his final exam yet. His quizzes are literally the hardest thing ever that I've ever read. His weekly quizzes are insanely difficult , tricky, confusing. If you are not planning to go to the faculty of psychology, don't choose  this course. It is a GPA KILLER. This is the first time I feel studying psychology is irritating.", "Not a fan of the way the course is organized... its not engaging at all. Its tough work to make psychology boring, but those modules do an excellent job of it. Lots of easy concepts with pretentious, specific jargon. ", "This class was very difficult ", "Online modules are fairly straight-forward, and the chapter readings are long but clearly explained.  Most people have trouble with the course because the online quizzes mainly involve applicationcritical-thinking questions as opposed to straight-up knowledge.", "Avoid his class if you can. There were several modules in which there was incorrect information provided which confused students immensely. The lecture on Psychopathology provided information on an old, outdated version of DSM. In a university setting, you would hope that lecture material is updated as the evidence is updated.", "Avenue to learn allows you to go at your own pace to keep up with the class. But the avenue quizzes are just so hard!!! Most difficult first year class I have ever taken.", "Puts zero effort into helping his students.  Never even met him.  Basically just makes the web modules and now he'll probably keep on using those for years while continuing to get paid for not teaching.  My TA was great but a 50 minute tutorial per week isn't enough to be effective.  This course weeds out the people not commited to studying psych.", "The whole course was basically an experiment for Dr. Kim, where he asks to keep your grades and such for data - felt like the course was taught for all the wrong reasons. You were not told this at the beginning of the term (ironic considering we learn about ethics in psych experiments). Do not take if you are not a Psych major.", "The course is delivered by online modules, a textbook,  and a weekly tutorial. Weekly quizzes were challenging because they require you to understand the content vs simply memorizing but helped tremendously by exam time. Keep up with the readings, modules and use your tutorials effectively to ask questions/explanations, and you'll be fine.", "This course had interesting topics, but the modules made the content boring. There is no help provided, inexperienced TAs, and unbelievably tricky test questions. Don't take this course unless you are required to. If your average in the titanic, this course is the iceberg.", "Its an online course I absolutely hated it. The weekly quizzes were horrible. And Dr. Kim sucks.", "Not in psych major? DON'T TAKE THIS COURSE, period.", "I really liked this course. The quizzes are not that hard - the questions are based on how well you can apply the concepts you learned to real life. If you follow his and your TA's advice, you should do well in this course.", "Are you as smart as Stephen Hawking? if not, don't take this course. You cannot get help anywhere, no profs and inexperienced TAs", "Terrible prof! I never saw him in person only through web modules. Questions on weekly tests were brutal. The questions were worded to trick students and bring averages down. Worst mark first year. Don't take this course with him!!", "TERRIBLE!!! I love psychology and I'm in the PNB program now but first year was a struggle...online lectures DON'T HELP! All his test/exam questions are tricking you so watch out for it...seems like he's trying to bring people's marks down. if you aren't trying to get into a psych program, DON'T take these courses", "i personally liked him despite his oddly worded questions. He added in cool jokes and the course content was very interesting. His weekly tests were a little tricky but you get the hang of them by exam time", "he should try asking straight forward questions on quizzes. do NOT take his class unless you dont mind working hard for a poor grade.", "Great prof! To be honest, I was going into psych so scared, because I read the reviews about him from previous years! But DON'T WORRY. As long as you stay caught up in the online modules, read every now and then, do experimetrix and study hard for the final, you can get a good mark no problem! The workload is quite favorable too.", "Pretty entertaining and fun prof! Clear lectures but he covers way to much material in one module. Also, his modules should be lectures! I hated watching the modules every week! Tutorials helped a lot but make sure to have watched the modules before hand or you will be lost! Never gonna forget how much torture studying for that exam was!", "yes, his tests were hard but he makes the modules really interesting. i ended up liking psych by the end of the course. eventually though youll get used to his question style and you should be ok for the exam. he reuses some questions so review the weekly tests well", "Why don't people like Dr. Kim? I thought he was great! The weekly quizzes/lectures are tough, but he has little jokes and makes them more entertaining. There are plenty of resources for help, and the course is organized great!", "Just when you think your done with those painfully boring 1x03 web modules...... boom! heres 14 more. Joe takes interesting concepts and makes them boring. Could be way better. Sorry Dr.Kim", "The web lectures were ineffective, and the website only worked a quarter of the time. The final exam is written in riddles and worth 60% (can be lowered if your willing to be a guinea pig for experiments at Mac (not ideal for conestoga BScN students). Oh and if you're going to make your own text/handbook, EDIT it!", "1X03 & 1XX3 were my easy 12s in 1st year and it helps if you see them this way. Ideally, you can go into the exam with 100%. Make sure you understand why your answers are right/wrong. Buy and read the textbook at some point in time! DO NOT go into the exam never having written a quiz by yourself. Don't memorize! Understand! Elaborate rehearsal.", "Interesting concepts, but some quizzes and the exam were ridiculous. Each question is a like a riddle and it doesn't matter how well you understand the content. I felt like I was in a experiment during the exam and was waiting for someone to rush out and place an EEG on my head to measure my brain activity.", "Excellent web module lectures and well run tutorials. The case studies were very useful. This is not a course people should take if they struggle with understanding concepts. You will not do well in this course if you memorize information. The quizzes are tough, but this is a rewarding course with genuinely interesting content (esp for 1st year).", "One of the worst classes I have taken. Almost nothing is learned the entire term because quizzes are open book and almost everybody does them with friends forcing the average person to worry about a 60% closed-book final. Quizzes are ambiguous and don't seem to cover course content. Tutorials are high-school-y at best.", "Horrible class, do not take this unless you want to do something with it in life. For an elective this is an extremely poor choice. The prof does a test 1 week before the exam after classes have while there are exams going on so you have no time to study for it. The tutorials are a complete waste of time and the case studies are insulting.", "did not like that course. :( but the material was interesting. Did poorly on quizzes -_-", "The prof is funny and interesting guy BUT he makes the course difficult. His web lectures as his part of teaching method is ineffective. Tutorials supposed to be longer. He has some issues on giving information (particularly on the grammar) that confuse students to grasp the material. Tho psych is super interesting, I wish he'll be like other prof.", "Ok prof, hard quizzes", "I really liked Dr. Joe Kim, had him for Psych 1X03 and 1XX3. Quizzes were hard but not unreasonable (I'd recommend doing them with a friend or two) and live lectures for 1XX3 were very interesting. Exams were fair, much easier than the quizzes! Although difficult, I really enjoyed his courses", "his course 1x03 was quite difficult, it required so much effort for a first year course.", "Weekly quizzes are HARD!!!!!!", "Never knew what to expect from the weekly quizzes, sometimes I felt I did very well on the quiz, but end up doing terrible...and sometimes felt I did very bad on the quiz, but end up doing very well....", "Weekly quizzes are very difficult and time limit is very short. Content is difficult to comprehend. Professor is good but quizzes require a deep comprehension of all the material.", "Content was very interesting, but the way that the content is presented via web modules was very poor. The weekly quizzes were a very poor way of testing students,and very ambiguous. Dr. Kim also tries to be helpful during his office hours, but the way he teaches and the way he tests are two very different things.", "Quizzes are hard, but overall fair - as long as you actually study (not just look over and memorize). You can't just read, you have to be able to teach the content - explain it and apply it. It forces you to do weekly/daily work and prepares you well for later courses. Highly recommend it.", "He's the hardest prof ever, quizzes are completely unreasonable and the final is terrifying , i'm scared for my life :( discouraging when you wanted to go into psych :(", "Not as difficult as people have said that he is. Psych 1XO3 is an awesome course, and he goes out of his way to prepare students with study aids.", "Not a bad course, but his wording, especially on quizzes, was a HUGE issue for me. There's a difference between testing for comprehension and wording questions in such a way that you INTEND to fool people, and Dr. Kim toes that line very finely. Definitely not the easiest course to do well in.", "Worst course ever! No matter how you try u will fail. It is elitist ,with a bunch of snobby undergrads as you T.A's that only play fun games with you.Don't ever take it..wish I could have dropped it...", "I Feel that the quizzes are unfair no matter how hard you study you will FAIL!!!!!! :'(", "Famous", "His quizzes are extremely unreasonably difficult, no matter how much effort you put into it, theres no way you can get a good mark because the questions are difficult and UNreasonable", "i don't recommend anyone take this course. dr joe kim makes his questions extremely difficult and purposely words test questions to fool students.", "i don't recommend anyone take this course. dr joe kim makes his questions extremely difficult and purposely words test questions to fool students.", "he is the worst professor i have encountered of my four years at Mcmaster. He makes his quizzes and test extremely difficult. The content it self is easy to understand but he words his questions in a way almost as if he wants us to do badly.", "any class that is marked by attendance is ridiculous. I have never seen my professor once, which is pathetic considering this school is costing me $10,000. the quizzes are written in a way where you can argue that your answer is correct....although it is marked wrong. it seems as if kim is trying to fool people in his tests.", "Too many contradictions in the material (Avenue, eBook). Lots of spelling and grammatical errors in the eBook.", "Great prof. It seems that people I know who didn't do so well in this course really dislike him. However, I found his lectures very clear. His midterm was tough in a sense that you really have to think. If you try and understand the concept instead of just memorizing, you will do well.", "Well thought out and planned modules, lots of team to review the lectures as they were online and only tested on online lecture material. Allowed experiment participation for free marks. Presents his material in an easy to understand way and tutorials are set up well for answering questions. Great prof. I want to be a Psych TA!", "hes the most useless prof ever.. makes midterms and exams so hard", "I can respect that he took a lot of time into constructing this course but his methods aren't working and his class averages are proof of that. I felt like the students were just a part of an experiment of his. His tests were hard mainly because his wording was confusing. Tests are all application which I'm not sure is the best for 1st yr classes.", "He's class is way hard. It's kind of cool how the lectures are done online but I've never actually seen Dr. Joe Kim in person (I don't even know if he's real)! I don't think he should be teaching the first year pysch classes. I switched out of psych thinking it would be too hard after his classes.", "LOVE him! A very funny and engaging prof who made me love psychology! His midterms and exams aren't bad at all if you actually understand the concepts and aren't just memorizing everything, I've aced all of them so far. :)", "Lecture content and online quizzes/module &quot;checkpoints&quot; were consistently NOT at the difficulty level of the midterms or exam.  Also, there can be serious admin screw ups given the large course size - my exam was marked with the wrong answer key.  Only because I stuck up for myself was it double-checked - turning a 28% mark into a 64%.", "He was awesome. He told jokes that were actually quite funny and entertaining.", "Class was brutal; alot to remember. Allowed a cheat sheet for final exam, but didnt refer to it. Too much wasted time to read through a page.. I liked him", "Deceivingly hard. Even when you study you struggle with his midterms and exams. Good idea on web modules, I appreciated the Idea of watching lectures on my own time.", "He makes psychology interesting!", "Exams and midterms are very hard!", "Useless prof. Completely unapproachable when you have a concern regarding his course. Online delivery is fine, but the course is not user friendly because the lectures dont work in all browers. Exams/quizes etc are hard and studying for them barely helps because they are not based on lecture content. Considering Kim uses the same lectures term afte", "His exams psychologically test you rather than testing you on content. He wants to see if you take the mental-shortcuts he lectures on. Sadly though, Kim uses shortcuts in his lecturing. He stereotypes the average student as white Canadian w/ ADD. Lectures filled with misinformation. His academic standards of himself are highschool level at best.", "Exams are way hard", "He sucks..", "I really enjoyed Dr. Kim's live lectures and I found that the web modules were also set up well.  I didn't find either semester to be all that challenging, but then again I'm going to major in psych.  Definitely a fair prof.", "I was very interested in this class. The web modules were very informative. I found the format very engaging. All that said, the exams were incredibly hard. I felt as if I were being tested on the psychology of the exam rather than psychology, the subject.", "Monotone, organized. Sometimes his explanations are too wordy to understand and other times, they're right to the point.  Quizzes were easy, test and exam were fair (although they could have been worded differently so that they were easier to understand). In the end, I felt the marks were intentionally lowered.", "LOVE joe kim! he's so jokes. web modules were clear & interesting. the course was extremely organized & instructions were always clear", "wow, I totally disagree with the last person (I guess they didn't do well on their test!).  This course is amazing and really practical.  That's my favourite part.", "Quiz and assignment questions are riddles with mistakes that make it difficult to answer the questions", "Joe Kim taught the class through online lectures, which were really interesting. I was lucky to get a gr8 TA (anton) who was really chilled out and an easy marker. The exams are tricky, you have to think a lot.

Very interresting material, fair test questions.", "I'm a third year student who decided to take both intropsych courses as electives.  I can tell you that these were the best organized courses I have taken.

Tests were very fair.", "really, really cool.  students are challenged and my ta was great.  this course has got me interested in psych.", "i thought this course was very organized with excellent use of online tech resources.  if you've ever been to visit dr. kim's office hours, he's amazing!  really down to earth and funny.", "Kim's video lectures are very convenient and allow you to go over concepts which you may find difficult several times. As long as you make good notes you should receive a great grade. Be careful of the group projects, which can lower your mark. Be sure to stay on track with all material and assignments.", "He designed this course to fail. TA's are goofs, I write very nicely, but the TA did not understand my expressions and said I had bad grammer. Kim sounds like a robot. THE HANDBOOK IS USELESS, I suggested that he remove those outlines and place diagrams which are time consuming to replicate, was a bit rude about how it helps some people, yeah right", "Kim is a nice guy, but his tests are hard.  materials are really interesting, and Kim does try his best  to be a good prof. He is interested in running the course, and tries many innovative techniques to improve learning. It is unfortunate that the course is hard. But that is no reason not to take the course - most 1st yr courses are hard anyway!", "His lecture are too easy to understand; however, they don't match the level of his tests, his tests are unclear and very hard comparing to the lectures and tends to attempt to trick you with a lot of frustrating similar choices on MC section.", "Lectures are convenient, yet rather boring at times. The midterm was ridiculous, but the material in the course CAN be interesting.", "Good prof overall. Made a lot of changes to the course, mostly for the good. Never met him in person, but the lectures - video - were very clear and for the most part well put together", "First year psych is great overall. Material is interesting and easy to relate to. Online lectures are incredibly convenient and Dr. Kim explains most things very well. The textbook is a waste of money. Attend the tutorials, take good notes, and you're set!", "A little tougher than first semester, but still found the course incredibly easy.

He was extremely clear and to  the point in his lectures, and is clearly very knowledgeable about the subject that he teaches.It's crazy important to go to lectures, and do all the readings, it's not an easy class, but Dr. Weaver makes every effort to help students understand the course.", "His assigned workload is by no means easy, however if you do your readings you will understand the material.  Dr. Weaver seems to be a little disorganized in his teaching-style but he is a very, very intelligent man!  If you attend every lecture it will benefit you for the exam!! You will learn more than you think by listening to him lecture.", "All around great guy - he cares so much about his students and is always ready to help. Incredibly intelligent and knowledgeable guy, but I was easily able to get an A in his course. He is very open to different opinions most of the time although he has high expectations for participation.", "easy classes but very dry", "Dr. Weaver was a fantastic professor.  If you ever have the opportunity to take a seminar with him, he comes highly recommended.", "JCW is truly a man beyond compare.  As I always say, if JCW doesn't know it, it's not worth knowing.  When he takes his glasses off and closes his eyes, you had better be prepared with your pen and paper to take down what comes next.  It's not WWJD, it's WWJCWD.", "Dr. Weaver is the GREATEST PROF TEACHING AT MAC. You have to take at least one of his courses. He cares about the learning of a student, as well as the student. He is clear in his lectures, and he has an undying passion for what he teaches. He makes you laugh, understand and gives his students a little bit of his passion for history. HE ROCKS!!!!!!", "Nice prof. Dr.Weaver alway volunteers to help and he'll always reassess your assignments if you're not happy with the mark. However, he could try to organize his lectures more efficiently, and he should definitely pick some better TAs.", "Awesome prof, one of my favourites now that I've had him. Truly concerned about and interested in his students, wants to get to know you. Well organized and interesting lectures, easy to pay attention. Can ramble a little, but it's always something informative even if not relevant to the exam. Very fair marker. More than willing to help!", "Dr. Weaver is by far one of the best profs ive had.  The subject matter of the anti cedents course is soo vast and Weaver explains it very well.  Weaver is down to earth and genuinly cares about what his students get out of the course.  You know hes about to explain something in detail when he takes his glasses off and starts by saying &quot;well. . . &quot;", "At firts I found the lectures difficult to follow because he doesn't use any overheads or anything. I had barely no notes by the end of the course but he's a very fair marker. He's also really nice and interesting for a history professor.", "Dr.Weaver is a pioneer in the history department at mcmaster.  His Anticedents of globalization course is absolutely unprecendented.  And, im sorry if you dont understand his vocabulary (person below) but he is probably one of the most brillian profs at mac right now.  (Swett and Horn also!)", "Dr. J has to be the best prof at McMaster.  When one thinks about the history department, Weaver is right there.  The man is a Rhodes Scholar from Duke, but yet a very down to earth individual.  I teach history at the grade 10 level and i hope to be like him someday!", "This guy is hilarious!!  He has got a voice like Jimmy Stewart (Its a Wonderful life) and he has some serious facial expressions that use every muscle of his face (including his eyebrows).  Honestly, down to earth, passionate (about his subject) and quorky...in a good way.", "If I understood his vocabulary, I would have had more patience in his class", "The most amazing professor. Who else could get excited talking about civil planning history. Dr.Weaver has to be the most wonderful professor that Mac history department has ever seen.", "Awesome prof, quirky sense of humour. Take any class you can with him, but be prepared to work. An interesting course with a prof who knows and enjoys the material.", "BEST PROF on campus. helpful, friendly and knowledgable on so many topics. Take his classes - he is inspiring and approachable. The best part of the History dept.", "The comments thus far have not done Weaver justice. He is an amazing prof AND definately the hottest male prof in the history dpt at Mac. He is the most knowledgeable professor as he is great in many different areas-not just ONE field of specialization.", "Only one thing can be said about Dr. Weaver: a true gentleman in every sense of the term!", "Dr. Weaver inspired my love of social history.  I currently teach grade 12 Canadian history and I find mysely relaying stories from Weaver's weekly seminars - 16 years ago.", "One of the GREATS, He taught me for 2 years,.

His lecture slides are not easy to look at.. very disorganized and all he does is read from the lecture slides. He never shows in-class examples", "Exceptional teacher, with superbe  knowledge of course material. Encourages you to become better student with regular iclicker evaluations. Taught well and punctual to classes. Shows up almost all classes and let you know few times he is absent. One of the best EE profs at Mac.", "Pros 1. When he does come, he gives clear explanations and tries to make you understand. 2. His test are somewhat fair. 3. Responds quickly to emails Cons 1. Misses nearly half of the lectures 2. No answers to the multiple choice questions he puts in the lectures and tutorials   Overall the cons heavily outweigh the pros.", "This is the best guy in the universe. Clear and nice. He is a good guy. I r8 8 out of 8 m8. If only I could take this course all over again.", "Shows up half the time yet expects students to never miss a class. Doesn't post any answers to the problems. Although it may be tough, avoid at all costs.", "No supportive ", "Amazing class - lectures have helped a lot in my practical work.

AMAZING!", "miserable spending my time in his  classes.", "One of the best ee profs. Before this course I had little interest in analog electronics. But he made things very interesting. He is passionate about the subject and getting the students educated. His teaching is superbe. Attend class and do icliker questions to keep  up. Highly recommended.", "Outstanding teacher for analog electronics. Well organized, brilliant and fun to sit in class. Presents course material clearly and answers questions in detail.

Learnt a lot from course and exams. Amazing knowledge of subject.", "I attended most of the classes. The lectures were well organized and delivered.

Do not be swayed by handful students who do not come regularly to classes and criticize him for being consistent and fair.", "One of the best teachers who cares that we learn and become self learners.

Avoid at all costs.", "His tests contain 4-7 questions, each question contains 6 - 10 sub mc questions, and each mc question contains 12 - 20 answers.

Good luck.", "If you want any hope to passing this course. Hope harder, cause you're in for one helluva ride..", "I had an interest in analog electronics, but Deen killed it.

Miserable.", "He goes on about how he has taken courses on teaching, that he loves teaching and yet everyone i know in this class despises his teaching method including me.

Well prepared for classes. Approachable and empathetic to students. iClicker questions helps a lot. I attend all classes as the text and notes are sufficient for a good understanding of the material and the practical aspects of analog circuits. Exams cover material in class & labs - reinforce learning. One of  best classes.", "Goes over simple material slowly, skims over complex new material. Test are unfair, covers material not explained in lecture. Textbook is terrible, very wordy and focuses more on quantity than quality. Clicker questions are bad, he displays an equation on the slides, then takes it away for the question, so you HAVE to bring notes to class.", "He is truly excellent professor - the best I have had so far. He is very smart, crystal clear in lectures, always well-prepared and organizedlogical. Tests are fair, and are not repeats of examples or assignmemts like in some other courses. Students who do not do well deserve it - do not whine. Attend classes and revise second year material.", "A great professor, true gentleman and exceptionally gifted.

Told us this was one of his best group of students in past decade.", "This is most exciting course I took. The prof was very good at explaining concepts.

Spent a lot of tiem preparing lecture nmaterial and problems to guide and enforce learning. Exams were on the whole very fair. And as he explained, he cannnot reteach the second year material. Very knowledgeable and approachable. One of my best classes so far.", "Somewhat unfair with delivery of material. As someone right said important points are not emphasied such as Is in BJT which was revealed after it was tested on the lab test. Lab 4 does not even have soutions. Prof or TA's dont know how to do the analytical part themselves. He should definately put solutions online for students benefit.", "teaches well. some students pushes him to reteach earlier courses. good that he has ethics unlike some other profs who give exams using problems covered in class. exams are fair if you attend class and pay attention. great at explaining/teaching from basics during office hours.", "I attened 99% of lectures, and all the labs, but it turns out a lot of the information is withheld from the student, which ends up being tested on. Make sure to ask a lot of questions about the Current sources and Oscillators-PLL as they are very important. Not really a fair intstructor.", "Explains well on bb. Very helpful in explaining in office. Builds on 2nd year courses. Fair exams if you attend classes.", "Tries to explain, but assumes too much knowledge which is not good because if he really wanted to teach, he should start right with earlier courses such as CI and EI. He does his work on blackboard, BUT he skips so much content relevant for the tests. Don't be shy to ask him a lot of questions in class to make sure you understand else u can fail.", "Too much content was forced into the 4 month course. The prof was usually not accessable during office hours, even if he was there he rudely continued working on his computer. At least one question on final exam was related to another course, communication systems and radio.", "This professor makes questions unnecessarily tough. He does not teach a lot of things he tests students on. Goes too fast for students to understand.

Overall awesome prof. knowledgeable with good practical explanations. However, assignments are difficult and long.", "Great explanations. Good sequence of topics. Should give handouts so we can keep up with material. Tests, in retrospect, were quite fair, even though averages were not as high as in other courses. Learn ur circuits and 2ei5 class materials well if you want to get high grades in this class. Very helpful during office hours, but gives no hints.", "Amazing memory and understanding of analog electronics. However, should provide on-line materials students. Should also make exams a bit easier and allow for more marks for homeworks and lab reports. I know that he wants tu us to learn well, but having only exams degrades our marks. Is very helpful and polite to students.", "Clear and concise lectures. Very good explanations of analog circuits. Good information on practical aspects of course. Labe very useful. However, did not like the  cahnge for lab exams as this addss too much stress. Other that that, great course.", "Outstanding lecturer. Clear explanations. Got a good grade in this course by attending lectures and following his teaching. Great job. However, his waqy of teaching may not be best for weak students. I am much better in analog electronics becaise of his course. Thanks and keep up the great job.", "Excellent at explaining analog electronics and teaching. Understand well is class, but have difficulties doing problems on my own. Helpful prof. Keeps to his course outline. Changed evaluation from previous year to more emphaisis on individual efforts. Make sure to do labs yourself as there are now lab exams. No pushover and study for exams.", "One of the best courses I ever took, and I have take many courses with excellent grades. Excellent communicator and teacher. Motivates students, is well organized, but is a bit demanding in his assignments, even though he explains the rationale. I learnt a lot in his course. I recommend it to others interested in improving their reserach abilities.", "Very decent prof. Encourages you to learn. Has to keep up with material or you may be overwhelmed. Follow his advice and attend lectures. Do not listen to the handful of students who gripe because he challenges you to learn.", "Great teacher. Excellent course. Lots of work, but worth it.", "Horrible professor in every aspect.  Pretty sure any good review on here was written by him. Embarrassing that he has to do that.", "This course was an utter disaster. There was no structure or outline to the course, and Deen essentially covered material sporadically with no logical flow from one lecture to the other. His response to material covered on the midterms was essentially &quot;read the entire book&quot;. I feel as if I learned nothing new from taking this inconsistent course.", "with 10 being the best, he would get 3. His lectures are incomplete, labs are disaster and he lacks focus. Tries hard to be entertainer, repeating (and waiting on answer on) &quot;have you seen this before&#63;&quot; and staring at H(s) trying to recall if it is correct, instead of just deriving it. makes many mistakes, sometimes corrects himself. Sloppy...", "This was one of the best courses I had as a graduate student. The lectures were clear, well organized and the key points were properly emphasized. The assignments were hard, but fair. While the project was a &quot;killer&quot;, I must confess that I learnt a lot. Prof. Deen cared about us learning the material - great job.", "I took this course in Fall 2010 and I worked over the surrer. On looking back, the techniques learnt - circuit analysis and design and intuition on analog electronics is proving very useful in my communications course. Thank you Prof. I appreciate you not spoon-feeding us. I am now a better student for your hard work.", "Some comments on the site have said that students are spreading lies about Dr. Deen. I can only imagine he wrote those as this class last year was the worst experience of my academic career. I did well in the course but didn't learn much because rather than spending time explaining material he focused on how amazed he was we didn't know it.", "He is one of the rudest professors I have ever had to deal with. When I went to see him for help he told me it was a waste of his time. He understands the material and is knowledgeable but can't teach. I learned very little from his class and it was an important one so that is kind of sad. Avoid him if you can.", "Now at end of third year, my impressions of this course has improved significantly. Professor was clear in explanations, made up interesting problems and examples and his quizzes were fair. Must attend lectures - explanations and some material not in text, plus  taught second half of course on chalkboard.", "Fantastic teacher - great at explaining concepts and helping students. Open office hours and available to help students individually. Very courteous. Need to study rgularly to do well. Exams challenging but fair - not a pushover. Now I have a summer job, I really appreciate his style of getting us to learn. A master of electronics.", "outstanding treaching and course - if you want to learn analog electronics. exams were challenging but fair, unlike other courses that had test questions that were minor variations of exampls or homeworks. i recommend this course to others interested in learning and not only in passing. great job and thanks.", "I enjoyed this course very mush. The professor was excellent, despite a a few students making unreasonable demands for him to reteach most of their 2nd year circuits and devices course materials. He explained well and posed interesting problems. He also did not give tests that were minor variations of examples in class. Thank you for teaching us.", "It has been one semester since I took this course. Now I fully appreciate the efforts of Prof. Deen. Teaching us to manage our time, build on our fundamentals, reasoning and analyses, doing creative problems, have been very useful in my other courses. Please do not be sway by weak or non-industrious students. Many thanks for teaching us.", "A few students with poor backgrounds spread false information about this course and the prof. He is one of the most helpful and tolerant profs. His exams are very fair. If you attend class, yu learn a lot. His lectures are clear and he taught the second part of the course from memory on the chalkboard. He posted all his slides for the first part.", "Overall, terrible professor. Does not care much for his students, makes exams incredibly hard which in turn makes getting a decent grade incredibly difficult. FAIL JD, FAIL.", "the worst the rudest prof ive ever seen . average for final exam was around 25% , and for the last midterm it was around 24%. hes really arrogant and my advice , do not take any course with him", "Outstanding lecturer - explains well and thoroughly.

He treats students consistently very well.", "Very professional and really knows how to teach. Knows his stuff. Creates challenging problems. Helpful and kind to students.  Clear in expectations.", "I took ECE 740 last semester and now I am taking ECE 741 - Analog ICs. In both courses, Prof. Deen was an exemplary teacher.

Prof. Deen explains very clearly, challenges us to do better and creates a rewarding course structure for all students.

The project forced us to learn to apply theory to create useful ICs. While is not easy, he is very fair and helpful.", "Outstanding prof with superbe background. Extremely helpful to students. One of the best courses I have taken - excellent combination of theory and practice. Course objectives are clear and course project forces you to apply theory. Exams are not easy, but are very fair.

Love love love this prof.", "Would not wanna take again", "Dr. Colavecchia is simply one of the best, if not best profs. I have come across at McMaster. She is insightful and explains theories and content in her lectures in a way that gets students to think outside the box. Her classes challenged my own views of society and I am so privileged to have been taught by her. Amazing person.", "By far the best prof that I've had to date. Very clear teaching style and she has a way of taking terms/theories and explaining them in a way that is easily understood. Simply fantastic! Should of received higher grade but I procrastinated on the term papers but aced the tests.", "People say her lectures are boring but I didn't find that. Loved that they were podcasted! I will say - I got a very high grade on the research proposal but did not do as well on the paper itself.. I think the expectations could have been clearer for that portion of the assignment. Overall, I'd take her class again.", "the driest, most boring class that was hard for no reason. Her material barely made sense, and the lecture attendance proved it.", "Her lectures are insanely dry, and her quizzes are either extremely easy or overly hard. There is no in between. I never go to her classes because her lectures are podcasted. That is the only good thing about her besides there being no exams. I really do not recommend her.. I don't like her whatsoever", "Love this prof. Realistic, straightforward, and intelligent. If you do the readings and listen in lecture, you'll do great.", "Her lectures are super dry. Considering Sociology is such a popular subject, I was disappointed by how boring classes were. (That being said, I appreciated that she also posted podcasts of her lectures).  Also, the multiple choice questions she takes up in class are very misleading. Test/quiz questions are much harder than the practice questions.", "I hated her as a prof, lectures were dry, the TA's were badt, it was unclear (I found) what she wanted for her essay. Her tests I need a dictionary to figure out some of the words.", "She's a great prof who explains concepts very well. Her lectures are a little dry, but you'll be fine watching the podcasts. Her quizzes aren't too difficult, as long as you make good notes during lectures, and read the textbook. Definitely possible to get a 12", "Great prof! Her lectures are very clear, and podcasts are SO helpful. She covers very interesting material, and sets you up with the potential to do well. The only thing that I didn't like about this course was the way the essays were structured. I would absolutely take a course with her again!", "Amazing prof! Podcasts are super helpful and she clearly states how to get an A. Would take any class with her!", "I am in love with this Prof. Her lectures are SO interesting and relevant to real-world concepts and ideas, barely do the reading (except Becker) and am receiving a very good grade because I am actively engaged in the lecture material. She's very nice, speaks very clearly, no surprises on tests (very clear questions), no final exam, awesome course!", "Amazing prof! ", "The podcasts were extremely helpful, especially for students who only had sociology that day. If you take extremely detailed notes (really important if you want to do well) and do your readings, you should be able to receive a double digit score. In terms of the assignment, I found the teaching assistant extremely helpful in guiding me.", "Shes a great teacher. Kinda funny but really sweet :)", "This is the only class of my semester I genuinely enjoyed learning about - all real-life specific and easy to understand. SUCH AN AMAZING PROF to listentalk to, plus her podcasts are a LIFE SAVER", "She is very well-spoken and articulates her ideas well (super helpful as this course was also podcasted for students listening from home). Provided many practice questions for her quizzes. The best part was there were no exams for this course. Merely, six quizzes throughout the semester each focusing on 2-3 chapters of material and a big paper!", "I really like her! Super professional and non-emotional which I think may get misinterpreted by some. But she knows her stuff and discusses interesting content in a  well organized, clear way. ", "A professor that will not respect answers that may seem silly and has no patience, even when she is in the wrong. ", "Really explains expectations clearly, I loved the podcasts because after lectures I listened to them at home and this helped for reviewing at exam time. She was extremely compassionate with some struggles I was experiencing. I loved her class and would certainly take all her other courses in upper years. She's strict with talkers but very fair. ", "favourite class by far, super easy just go to lectures and you'll be fine, lowest grade for me was an 80. rarely did you need to do readings if you attend class and tutorials were not mandatory.", "EXTREMELY clear. Talks with the most clarity I've ever encountered. Her enthusiasm and interaction with the students is quite uplifting. The way she delivers her lectures are worth attending to. You can easily get an A- or B+ with minor effort. But note, I still said EFFORT!! She's great!!!", "very interesting lecturer makes course material interesting and fun. She clearly goes through concepts and things we should focus on for tests, exams and assignments.", "great prof. never went to her class, never read any of the textbooks, just listened to the podcasts and made notes and got a very good mark. i like the fact that she podcasts every lecture.", "The only textbook that was useful she recommended was New Society. The rest like SIQ and the writing book were useless or you can find them at Mills. Her lectures were interesting and easy to follow along. She talks quite fast and expects you to write. Also, don't talk to your friends or she will call you out and will really kick you out.", "If you attend or listen to all of the the lectures there is no reason you can't do well in this course. She gives very clear instructions on the assignments, all tests are multiple choice. I finished the class with a perfect grade.", "Dr. Colaveccia was an incredible prof. Her class is very much one in which you should attend both lecture and MAKE SURE TO READ YOUR TEXTBOOKS THOROUGHLY. You'll do fine if you do both these things, if not, you'll fail easily. Tutorials were boring, and not necessary. As a prof, though, she's interesting and quite funny, I loved going to lecture!", "She is rude when you talk to her one on one. She is also very difficult to follow durring lectures because she is so dry. Her questions are poorly worded and uses trick questions. She talks a lot, and makes the course hard to be interested in, she through me away from sociology for good.  Did not like her as a prof at all.", "Brutal difficult class", "Honestly, if you love listening to older women babble on about their children and friends then this is the class for you! Also she speaks so slow, I could barely keep my eyes open.. lectures are almost wholly derived from the readings. Her quizzes were easy to ace but probably as a result of her repetitiveness.", "such an amazing prof!", "Good, easy class. Puts up podcats and powerpoints online. I ended with an A and decided to major in Criminology(at York University) following this course. Recommend it.", "Was intimidated by her at first, but shes a very sweet lady. Interesting stories, great presentation. Clear and concise. I attended all her lectures, took VERY thorough notes in class and did not read the textbook...I ended up getting a 90%. There is a midterms and exam ( multiple choice), 4 or 5 short quizzes worth a few percent and a paper.", "Prof Colavecchia's way of teaching is extraorindary compared to many other profs. While i cant always attend lectures due to work conflicts, i appreciate her use of podcasts. She is extremely knowledgeable and approachable. A++ in my books!", "Very engaging in her lectures and tries to keep the class participating. One of the few profs who relates academics with real world scenarios (essays, timelines, punctuality)... Can sometimes treat students like they are younger than they seem, but not intentionally. Very fair and a great professor overall...If you wanna talk in class, then leave!", "Amazing professor, really loves her job. ALWAYS replies emails. I love her way of teaching, it's like a talk show. Also we learn how to apply the theory in creative ways which help me remember all them, although i took this class 2 years ago", "Her exam review slides were helpful to me but every class she put me to sleep.", "Did not enjoy class. Could have been the material, could just have been her.", "She is a good prof who seems to really enjoy teaching, however can treat her students like they are children. Its amazing when she kicks people out because they are talking!! She stands at the podium the entire class and reads off of her notes. Hard to keep my attention because she doesn't move- would love it if she walked around.She seems nice tho", "Great Prof! Can seem a bit intimidating during lecture, only because she doesn't waste time with annoying or disruptive students (rightfully so). But in person she's very sweet & approachable! You can tell she loves what she does which is what sets her apart from a lot of other profs.", "Dr. Colavecchia knows her material and her interest is genuine and infectious. She does move slowly sometimes but if you pay attention, it's easy to figure out what will be on the exams because she emphasizes points repeatedly. This professor genuinely wants her students to do well and with some effort and good attendance, double digits are easy.", "great professor, VERY interested in student input. wants to hear feedback and opinions from everybody. her exams aren't overly difficult if you study for them and keep your notes up to date. overall, i totally loved her and am looking to take more of her classes in the future.", "", "First year sociology: makes it EASY to get above 6 with her syllabus. Doing all the small assignments takes maybe 5 minutes each, some are helpful in learning the material, but all are an EASY MARK. Her lectures can be a little dry, but   are important. Her midterm/exam questions are fairly lengthy. Overall, very helpful and ENJOYS student input.", "Shes always willing to listen to stories and help anyone who has any question. Her knoweldge of the material is quite profound. However her lectures move really slow and she treats her students like were all complete idiots. I also didn't find it very entertaiing but thats a personal thing.", "", "Very slow at speaking, can be very boring, tends to repeat things WAY too much, and her ego is a bit inflated...even after that all, she is an okay professor.", "Very cut and dry teacher - what I thought was going to be an interesting class has been totally ruined by her.

Take notes during the poetry unit - it WILL help you for the final exam - but I found the short story unit to be better discussed in tutorial. Heed all the advice you can from your TA as they determine your essay marks!", "Donaldson's enthusiasm is great, and his lectures are fun.  Harder to get a good mark, as many things are subjective, open to interpretation. Donaldson uses metaphors and examples in class that will come back to you in quizzes ... even if they only make sense to him. Many upper year science students take this course (required), making avg higher", "Dr. Donaldson can be hard to follow sometimes, he uses a lot of metaphors and digresses a lot, but his enthusiasm about the subject matter makes up for it.  ", "his lectures aren't necessarily helpful for the course but are really interesting. he appears to love his job and loves class participation! he listens to every point of view. however, if you're someone who needs clear instructionstraightforward guidelines you will not find them from him, he's really open to interpretation and not always clear", "English and English major are two different languages. Drop the class if your tutorial TA isn't getting back to your emails, or try to transfer to a tutorial with one that will. You're going to pick up a little bit of what Donaldson likes when you go to his classes but ultimately you need a more competent and communicative TA to do well.", "A very disorganized and confusing professor. Made it difficult to understand the assigned readings and to pull any meaning from them. Without the help of your TA you are completely lost in this class.", "Quirky sense of humour, but very interesting. Goes off on tangents very often but they are always interesting. Very approachable and genuinely nice.", "Cool cat. Interesting and interested. His lectures are conversational in nature so he'll often go off on tangents or just say a lot of interesting stuff that isn't directly useful for your exam or essay or whatever. Thus it's hard to take notes, but I sat back every lecture and just took it in, and I did fine.", "slides are engaging. He's got a good sense of humor. The class times were annoying though 8:30am. He does tend to ramble but overall he's a good prof and the course was easy.", "He was alright", "Great prof :) quirky sense of humor, and easy to get off topic. Lectures were engaging, although a bit disorganized. He frequently read the poems aloud, which was interesting at first but became annoying rather quickly. Very lengthy readings, and impossible to figure out how he markes. Overall, approachable and funny, but a bit disorganized.", "Very nice professor with a quirky sense of humour. He seems to be a little detached and scatterbrained, but those just seem to be the traits of a true professor. Offers great analysis on the style and craft of writing. He can however be a little disorganized, and his marking scheme is pretty unpredictable.", "I think he's awesome! His powerpoint slides for this class were really engaging and he is a nice professor, he is approachable and very sincere. Just you have to pay attention to whose your T.A, they are ummm lets say not too nice. But his exam was a fair game too", "Dr. Donaldson is the greatest!", "Great teacher and a great person. Donaldson really cares about his students and is very engaging. He was sometimes unorganized but is well educated and knowledgable about what he's teaching, so I never felt like I was missing some key information. Did a great job of teaching Frye's four variations.", "He is my favorite English professor. I had him for British literature (2I06) and children's lit. He knows how to engage the students and because of him I've learned how think way outside the box and deeply analyze. He's funny and interesting. His exams for both classes have been easy. However, they do require you to do all of the readings.", "Dr. Donaldson is, and will always be, my favourite professor. I often think that those who criticize him just don?t get him or what the humanities is about. He is brilliant!", "It is a man's MIND that determines where he is &quot;Hot&quot; or &quot;Not&quot; - Donaldson's sears. He is scatterbrained, a rambler, off topic almost always and absolutely BRILLIANT. Does not use traditional methods of teaching &, in a class of 300, will still listen to every student. Friendly. Genuine. Dresses like a bum but I adore him - favourite professor.", "Dr. Donaldson was a great prof! He is really open to everyone's ideas and likes to let the students run the class. He is a very interesting and smart person!", "so, donaldson refused to use a microphone even though myself and several other students were unable to hear him in lecture. when asked why not, he repsonded that he &quot;likes to feel free&quot; - meanwhile, even sitting right up front - his freedom let him wander the class so we missed half his lectures.", "Pointless class, subjective marking on creative writing assignments, had to do it his way or the high way.  Hardly any constructive criticism offered, no organization or structure.  Our group workshops were a waste of time.  He sat there doing nothing and hardly any of my group members showed up or bothered with the class.  Never again.", "Pretty average prof. Half the time I got the impression he was making his lectures up as he went. Good for an first year course.", "Stupid course but the prof was good.  Very thorough on essay marking", "Great class, knows his stuff, fairly interesting lectures, and makes cute references to outside culture. take any class of his that you can", "the class was good, and he was a very detailed lecturer, but the materials themselves were not that exciting.  i liked the class but i did not like the choice of poetry at all ... still, that might not have been his fault", "This prof is absolutely AMAZING! Take any class with him that you can! He really cares about his students, and is more than willing to help you out if you need it. He is also really interested in students' ideas not only about materials, but also on how the course is run.", "alright teacher, tends to ramble.", "No Comments", "Had him back in the day, but I still attribute most of what I understand about poetry to his lectures. A brilliant prof and scholar. Had him for a grad course too, and it was tough but rewarding.", "this guy rocks.", "Very fair marker, good constructive comments on essays given back.  My inquiry class with him was one of the best classes I have had thus far.", "I really like Dr. Donaldson.  I had him in first year too...and he was good then for shorter genres.  He is very passionate about poetry and he seems to like teaching.  I found him a very fair marker and he gave helpful comments.  I am pretty shy, but he made me feel comfortable speaking in class.", "took short genera. tue and fri 8.30 in the hanngers... no nice. ended up with a B but i still didn't like the class, the tutorials we far more better. his notes were strange, sorta like him. oh well", "Brilliant man - - interesting methods of lecturing and assingments.

A lot of writing, but the 1-minute break is helpful!", "Azoulay rocks my world.....if I were a women, he would be the father of my children........", "Excellent prof, as were the lectures. He knew his stuff, and made a lot of the material very interesting. Lectures were great, one minute breaks are VERY helpful! The exam was perfect, covered the whole course without being stupidly hard. Highly recommended prof! (and strangely hot too)", "One of the best profs at mac. Witty remarks while lecturing, follows his notes and leads a great lecture. I've had him for two classes now and he's been great both times. Definitly take America in the 1960s with him. Good job DJ-Zou!", "he gave a good lecture.. AND i had probs with a mark, and he was extremely helpful to me.", "great teacher, dry humour, one minute breaks, &quot;on this day in history&quot;... doesn't keep you longer than you need to be", "This is my second class with Azoulay, and I love his classes.  I love that he gives essay questions on the first day, and he puts difficult words you encounter on the overhead, so you cn follow along.  And you have to love the sweaters!", "Honestly, one of the most amazing profs that MAC has.  If you have the opportunity to take any of his classes you should.  He is so intelligent, and makes you interested in the topics that he is discussing.  The one minute break during lecture is the smartest thing a prof can do!", "I wasn't even registered for this class and I still went because Azoulay was amazing-ay! So interesting, spoke like a baptist preacher, and oh man, don't even get me started on the one minute break - genius!", "Amazing. Smart, interesting and oddly hilarious (the **** lecture will long be remembered). Great tutorials and course readings. A definite favourite . . and the one-minute break is much-appreciated."], "credit": ["N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A",

A bit quirky, but his tests are rather fair and I did very well in his classes. Not the best prof at Mac by any means, but provides some entertainment value as well as decent clarity in lecture.", "Dr. Haley is an example of what I often refer to as an \"old school\" prof. This man is incredibly knowledgeable about his field and will give students an intricate look into the respective subject. Being said, sporadic episodes of blatant rudeness to students and humourous anecdotes make him an acquired taste", "Dr. Haley was a great prof to have, and he is one that I recommend having. He does talk quickly, and he can be rather eccentric, but he's also very knowledgeable and easy to approach. His tests and exams cover only the material that he has given in class and through readings.", "The best prof I have ever had.  If you have an interest in ancient Greece and Rome this prf really knows everything about the topics.  He may eccentric bt he's interesting and very knowledgeable.  Thank you Dr. Haley.", "Worst prof I have ever had. His lectures are almost impossible to follow, he's rude to students (although most deserve it). He can't keep his thoughts straight and gives tons of unnecessary info. He takes 10-20 minutes to answer some of the most basic questions just because he goes off on tangents. Seems to resent that students don't like him.", "DROP HIS CLASS NOW. Not only is he a terrible professor, he is an unkind man. Since he teaches classics, he should be familiar with Julius Caesar syndrome. The superiority complex this man has  seriously inhibits his ability to do his duty as a professor. Seriously. Run. Now. Faster.", "I'm impressed with his knowledge and passion for academics, but I think he forgets that many of us lowly undergrads have no background in Greek or Latin and limited prior knowledge. The overheads don't help much so I'm forced to take notes phonetically and try to look up the terms later (and the tests make this necessary). Hope you can write fast.", "He is a very knowledgeable professor, but he is extremely disorganized and can't process his thoughts clearly enough for his lectures to make any sense. He goes on tangents, and makes annoying and unnecessary noises during the lectures which lead to frustration. For those reasons it is next to impossible to take meaningful notes from lectures.", "Attended every lecture, completed all the readings, took extensive notes, and almost failed his midterm. Memorize useless, minor facts and dates and you might have a chance. Attending lectures is pointless. Stay home and memorize the textbook instead. Very intelligent, but should not be a professor.", "Worst prof i've had to date.. could not understand a word he said. Tended to backtrack and re-state things he already went over in 'Latin' - almost seemed like I should have taken Latin as a prerequisite.", "Haley is an excellent professor. For the student who wants to learn he is more than willing to help and I never had a problem meeting with him to ask questions or to clarify a topic he had discussed in lecture. He is a serious academic and its too bad that students today aren't more concerned about learning than being entertained.", "Although he is very knowledgeable and funny, his lectures are essentially him reading and not explaining. He goes off on little tangents that make writing coherent notes nearly impossible. He also doesn't respond to e-mails, which is rather annoying. He could be a great professor, but he isn't right now.", "Very intelligent and very knowledgeable about his subject. One of the nicest profs I've ever had.", "Possibly the worst history prof. I have had. Incomprehensible lectures, followed by evaluations that are based upon obscure facts from readings and lectures. He also brings roles of toilet paper into class to blow his nose with, I guess that is a teaching aid, either that or he wants to be repulsive to his class on an academic and social level.", "I had this guy over 10 years ago and the comments are reflecting what I also experienced.  This guy is smart as a tack, he knows the topics inside out, he is incredibly enthusiastic but he goes all over the place, he's a little like a squirrel crossing the road. I loved the information I got, but his lessons don't flow in a logical manner.", "It's clear that Haley knows what he's talking about and wants to share his knowledge with his students. Although it's easy to do well in his courses, you have to look out for irrelevant details since he cares more about obscure facts than key themes or concepts. He's also difficult to approach and frustrating at times.", "he's frustrating to listen to.", "He is a very kind of helpful professor. Seems to be very intelligent and knows his stuff.", "He sometimes goes on tangents but he's extremely entertaining and very very nice. **how entertaining his class is depends on how close to the front you sit, get as close to him as you can**", "Great Prof, very straightforward. Makes very clear what you need to know. Explains and clarifies very well the material.", "Great Prof, really loves what he teaches and it shows. If you can't get at least a B in his class, you probably don't belong in university. He tells you exactly (and I mean EXACTLY) what you need to know. Know it, write the tests, and you're in the clear. You might even learn something along the way. Why anyone wouldn't like his class is beyond me", "Run...don't walk away from this one.", "This guy is the most boring prof on earth.  I went to class every morning and fell asleep.  His sentences never end and he never makes any sense.  He just jumps from one topic to another and never has any connections between topics.  I was lucky that i already knew allot about the topic.  If you know nothing about the material don't take his course", "What an utterly terrible professor. How he got into teaching is beyond me.. he's horrible. His incoherent speaking patterns are abysmal, and are only matched by his boring montonone and hard tests. He doesn't use WEBCT or use anything but an oldschool overhead that is impossible to see; he's terrible for help and overall the worst Prof at Mac. RUN!", "Dr. Haley is quirky but he has a vast amount of knowledge that he seems to desperately want to share. If you listen carefully, his thoughts do connect coherently with the occasional frayed edge because he just doesn't have time to say EVERYTHING he knows. His tests are difficult, but fair. Attendance and readings are required to do well. Nice guy.", "Basically, Haley is smart, but unapproachable, and is not a fun professor. He is virtually impossible to follow in lecture. His sentences never end and therefore, taking notes is very difficult. His tests are horrid. They ask ridiculous things such as the name of something you might read once in the textbook. His lectures are dull. Keep away.", "Mid-terms were fair. Exam had extremely difficult questions (requires you to know irrelevant details) outside the essay. Go to all your lectures and somehow force yourself to pay attention to his incomprohensible style. He's very intelligent he just can't teach well.", "I actually LIKED Dr. Haley.  Yes, he can be quirky, but he doesn't leave one wanting for detail.  He's honest, fair, and does seem to care about his students.  He is very helpful if you see him after class to clarify anything that was confusing in lecture.", "I didn't even buy the text because it was like a million dollars, but it didn't matter cuz he always read to us directly from it. Boo-urns, man. What a bad trip.", "The worst prof/teacher I have had at any level of schooling. The class would not be particularly difficult if he knew how to lecture. Sadly he knows his stuff and clearly is well read, but is the WORST lecturer I have ever met. Routinely reads lectures from the text and talks as though he is on the verge of soiling himself.PLEASE AVOID AT ALL COSTS", "This man is a mess. His voice moves up and down like a yo yo as he delivers a completely incoherent &quot;lecture&quot;. When he not on the verge of picking his nose he is nervously moving his pen around on the desk in front of him. He is a disgrace to Mcmaster University and it is truly a mystery as to how this man was ever allowed to lecture.", "No Comments", "I had to leave lectures on a regular basis because I get annoyed by repetitive motions, which was bad because Haley once moved a pencil 67 times in one lecture before I had to leave. He was well-educated, and I'm sure he knows his stuff, but I had a difficult time concentrating and his frequent voice level change startled me a lot.", "The man can't teach, nor speak and almost ran me over on his bike.", "Admittedly, his lectures are tough to follow, but he does seem to know what he's talking about. His courses compliment the textbook very well to ease the burden of following the lectures, in his defense.", "Horrible.  Quirky.  Idiot Savant.  Stay away", "Good prof, he knows what he's talking about. BUT AMAZINGLY BORING. There will be 20 minutes left on lecture and I'll manage to fall right asleep in front of him. Avoid him if you want to keep your passion about history, he'll bore the pants off you.", "HORRIBLE PROFESSOR. AVOID PROFESSOR HALEY LIKE THE PLAGUE. Anyone who claims this guy is brilliant obviously didnt come to class very often, it was like hitting yourself in the head with a brick repeatedly. Haley has obsessive compulsive little quirks, like he moves the stuff on the podium around 600 million times in a lecture. DROP THIS CLASS.", "No Comments", "He is very passionate about his work, and that is nice to see.  Hard to follow most lectures because of his distractive jumpiness, but I was told that he gets nervous speaking in front of large groups, so perhaps that's why.  Be sure to keep on top of your work because if you get behind...you will be VERY behind.", "I WILL NEVER TAKE ANOTHER CLASS WITH HALEY AGAIN.   He has sudden volume changes, jumps around, is obsessive compulsive, rearranges his books and ultimately is very unnerving.  I have no doubt that he is intelligent, but he stresses me out!  SAVE YOURSELF THE STRESS!!!", "Yes, Dr. Haley is definitely a genius. I still had a hard time in lecture. However, I like the assignment, quiz and midterm he gave us because they were fair.", "All over the place - intelligent but unnerving and a stressfullecture", "This guy is horrible!  He cannot lead a lecture, and is completely unwilling to help out the students.  I do the readings over and over, yet I am still unable to understand what is going on.  He is honestly the worst prof I have ever had!", "You have to be on your toes to do well in his class.  He's brilliant, knows his material, and if you try to feed him a load of crap he will totally call you on it.  He is the superhero of the dept., and genuinely CARES about his students' well-being.  He rocks!", "Seriously, it doesn't seem to matter if you do the readings - he still wants you to fail. I don't think that anyone can defend his lack of compassion and the fact that he repeats himself about 5 times before moving on. No matter how smart a man is those who can't teach shouldn't. And Haley can't.", "Haley is absolutely brilliant, and if you take the time to give him a chance his quirks become some of the best things about him.  He wouldn't be teaching if he wasn't truly phenomenal.  For those ignorant haters out there who negate his every move I consider it their loss. Hint: do your readings.", "Very brilliant dude.  He was looking especially frazzled today.  I saw in in the library and was going to say hi, but he was on a mission and I didnt want to get run over.  People might be angered by him because they actually have to be attentive and read the text.  That last test was torture though", "Because of Haley's refusal to put up overheads, the majority of class has given up on his incomprehensible lectures.  My condolences to those who are required to take his course.", "No Comments", "love the vests and the bike.  kind of an oddball.  has trouble modulating the his pitch when he speaks, and sometimes it seems like he's trying to hold in a burp.  otherwise, a fair marker with easy assignments/exams, and a brilliant man.  i recommend him.  entertaining (somewhat) and informative.", "I just dropped Haley's class, not because of the material, but because of Haley. It is simply stunning how inconsiderate and unclear Haley can be. I didn't know you could be that inept without trying.", "I think Dr. Haley is a really intelligent professor.  The only thing i want to convey to you all is that he sounds and acts like william shatner in star trek.  With short choppy bursts, you think he is going to yell out &quot;spock!&quot; or &quot;Bones&quot; any second! lol otherwise, great prof", "Dr. Haley is very eccentric and at first hard to follow - but if you stick with it, attending his courses will be one of the most rewarding experiences in your University career.  Show respect for him and he will do so for you - a truly brilliant man with an interesting sense of humour...  Go Haley!", "He has high expectations from his students. Or, he has low expectations, but still not easy tests. He makes himself available for extra help, and he works to make sure you understand the answers to the questions you ask.", "No Comments", "Way too cool. This guys knows his stuff. If you want the real deal, no BS, he'll give you the goods.", "Terrible professor. It is very hard to follow him and he tends to just follow the textbook. I don't recommend any courses taught by Evan Haley.", "A different type of proff. VERY intelligent and eccentric. Classes can be unpredictable. Far more helpful than most think. Dry witt, an excellent story teller if u can follow him. A character but a good man if you speak to him one on one.", "Very eccentric, but also extremely bright.  His exams are freakin hard, but the rest of the his classes aren't.  He's quite humourous.", "ECCENTRIC...COMPLETE WEIRDO BUT BRILLIANT.  nOT AN EASY PROFF BUT DEFINATELY NEVER SHORT OF HUMOR.  dEFINATELY BOX FULL OF CHOCOLATES...CHOCOLATES YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN IN YOUR LIFE...GREAT PROFF THOUGH", "the smartest prof i have ever seen... you never know what he is thinking...", "Really good class, great guy, very entertaining.", "He just reads from the text...and he's freakn' weird. Apparently his blood tastes strange...he told us this in lecture.", "Weird guy and very smart. No middle here, you'll either love him or hate him", "my second run with haley was a nightmare...his lectures are so overbearing", "He CRAZY!  but he gave us the exam questions so it is okay!", "one of the best profs ever! actually takes time to learn everyone's names!", "Smartest man alive, great prof, He knows anything about everything", "Amazingly knowledgeable, cares about students' understanding", "No Comments", "horrible lecture style, but very smart", "Knows everything about everything...facinating man", "Extremely witty and very knowledgeable", "No Comments", "No Comments", " one of the nicest profs ever but he does take some getting used to", "FUNNIEST PROF EVER,", "This man is brilliant, a non-stop thrill ride of historical evidence.", "smartest man i have ever met, very eccentric", "lectures are quite boring, but he's a good guy and teacher", "Seems to lose his train of thought every 30 sec, then takes 2 min to get back", "Poor lecture style;

He midterms and exam was basically memorization and if you studied the material you'll be fine. Make sure you come to class because you need her notes to do well. Her home study tasks are annoying but not an issue. Watch and read supplementary information, she tests from that too! She saved my mark from Dushoff.", "Her exam isn't hard, but its super detailed. Most of her section was pure recall and very little application. Her midterms were easy, you just need to memorize everything. You must look at the new info in the readings and you must go to lectures for her supplementary info if you want a good grade. She is a very nice prof and super helpful.", "She was an angel of a prof! Super caring and inspirational. It is much easier to do well if you regularly attend the lectures.", "If you don't go to her lectures, you WILL NOT get a good grade. Your mark often depends on the notes you make off her speaking and not from the lecture slides. If your notes aren't complete you will miss out on a lot of testable content. She definitely makes you work for the mark but show up and do the work and you'll be fine.", "She was a great prof, and I took her for Bio 1P03. The course content wasn't very heavy, but she took the time to explain it very thoroughly and answer all questions very respectfully. She really has a passion for teaching, which is always a boost.", "Great prof. Kept my attention in class. Organelle song my fave.", "Best prof I had for first year! She would incorporate videos/animations especially during applied lectures which I found helpful. Midterm SAs required you to know the nitty-gritty details from web modules and applied lectures but overall they were fair. Only complaint I have is that she would play the Organelles song one too many times before class", "She's a very optimistic professor that's highly passionate about the course she teaches. Her midterm mc were fair and not difficult, however her long answer does require you to attend and throughly understand her lectures.", "Dr K understands the needs of students and gives great advice. She's enthusiastic. Her tests questions are challenging but fair  they make  you to think about content and solve problems. If you attend lectures and follow her advice, you'll do fine.  I like how  she gave us  opportunities to help with research projects.", "I liked the iClicker questions ,they helped me to do concept applications. Gives good advice.", "Kajiura was an amazing prof! Her test and exam questions were super easy and weren't tricky at all, if you pay attention in class and use her lecture notes as a study tool, this class is an easy A! I didn't even make my own notes, just used hers and did great! An overall amazing prof!", "Good prof! Lectures showed me different perspectives and applications related to ecology.", "Lectures -- the more you go and pay attention, the less reading and catching up you have to do.  Reading- DON't read the whole textbook JUST read the graphs and figure legends and things you DONT understand.  Tutorials- Amazing in giving you a broader perspective  Overall, easy course--not too much effort.", "I liked Bio 1M03. The course is interesting, relevant, &  valuable to me even beyond this term. It revived my passion to take more Bio courses.", "Very good prof for first year. She goes beyond the course and gives tips on how o survive first year, and the material on the test is made very clear beforehand. She's a great prof, but this course is so boring.", "She makes you get use to solving application style questions, which is good . I'm a  Science Society rep and she  lets me promote our events before her lectures start and I appreciate that.", "Excellent prof this term ! Provides the fundamental concepts with linkages to applied  research, which I absolutely love! Tests are challenging but clearly worded and fair. If you follow her advice, you'll do well in the course.", "Still early in the course. Good so far. Realizing that I have to come prepared to Kajura's lectures  by reading the textbook and looking at her lecture resources or I won't understand the content. Just started following her advice about the learning objectives and its working okay and  glad I'm in this classtt", "Impressed me with her enthusiasm and patience. I enjoyed group lecture activities. Made some new friends that I otherwise wouldn't have. Final exam was challenging but fair coverage of the lecture information.", "Good prof with a positive attitude towards students. Held my interest in bio, especially ecology.", "Dr. Kajiura doesn't just spit out an endless amount of information. She provides concise lecture outlines of what she will discuss in class, so you don't have to mindlessly copy every word she says. Horrible Lecturer and very passionate about herself! However course material is very dry.", "She's an amazing prof who gives clear guidelines about how to study. If you come to class and pay attention to the concepts she emphasizes, you'll be fine for the tests", "Dr. Kajiura doesn't just spit out an endless amount of information.  She provides concise lecture outlines of what she will discuss in class, so you don't have to mindlessly copy every word she says. Great Lecturer and very passionate about what she teaches ! However course material is very dry.", "She was a great prof, loves teaching biology and loves her students. She always advertised her office hours, and the projects that she's involved in outside of class for students. Great opportunities to get involved, she's very slow paced in lecture, goes over concepts too clearly if anything! Her tests are also very straightforward.", "Great prof! I like how she encouraged me to take responsibility for my own learning and apply conceptual knowledge. A facet that I particularly liked about the lectures was that Dr. Kajiura  helped me with all of my questions and made me work to find the answers to my questions,  which helped my research skills and self directed work ethic.", "I really connected with this course! Classes covered lots of research examples, which were totally helpful. Home study questions were tough but rewarding to solve. Exam review was based upon what topics we had requested. Ecology requires looking at things through multiple ways, which is exciting. Already thinking of taking 3rd ecology courses.", "Heres the thing, she was super helpful! But her lectures, hellful! All she had were images and then shed ask us a question and then not answer it. Random facts everywhere (they showed up on the exam) however very enthusiastic and ready to help you. Very sweet lady imo. Easy midterm! Easy to do well if you keep up! ", "Lectures were organized with clear learning objectives with strong links to research applications in ecology. Final exam review was the best of my courses. Dr K and Marvin helped us who were nervous to raise our academic work ethic  by encouragement. Exam was a thorough evaluation of the concepts and fair.", "Loved Dr Kajiura's lectures and her teaching activities since the in class discussions opened my mind to research and biology. I'm more focused on my academic career now. I started out being passive in class but quickly found myself participating more and learning things more quickly with her lectures. ", "Kajiura is a very approachable prof. She is kindhearted and is definitely there for her students. Although she lacks a good teaching ability. Her lectures are often boring and I found that I could read the textbook and get the same out of it then going to lecture.", "Really like the 2F03 course, she helps me during  and outside of classes, her office study sessions are the place to be where I get  extra help. I went to all the midterm test prep sessions and did better on the midterm test because of them.   ", "Lectures are well prepared and interactive. I particularly like that Dr. Kajiura  covers several supplementary case studies and interesting examples outside of the textbook. I noticed that a previous posting incorrectly said that just using the textbook is sufficient, that's so untrue. I enjoy lectures and being able to talk to the profs.", "This course is a great experience for students in their final year of undergrad! There is no didactic instruction in this course, only major projects and small assignments completed in your group. Dr. Kajiura and her TA are always present if you need clarification or guidance.", "Like the interactive lectures with class discussions and linkages to ecological concerns that living animals and humans are currently facing.  All's good !", "Love Bio 1M03! Thrilled to be finally learning about biology with real world relevance that will affect my life and future generations. Really intrigued by course content and engaged by her teaching methods. Great prof- student interactions during in-class discussions. ", "Awesome professor!  Dr. K does a wonderful job teaching the course. She motivated me to want to learn about biology. Fun learning about the notable classic experiments. Yeah, Meselson Stahl experiment is classic!  I agree with her that it's important to acknowledge the amazing scientists of the past and the present.  ", "It was a pleasure having Dr. Kajiura for Biology 4A03. Her course has given me confidence in my research abilities. I loved collaborating with other research team members but also know that these classmates will remain my friends forever. I have a much greater appreciation of advanced topics in ecology! ", "was boring and talked more about her office hours and her experiences more than course content. her tests and exam questions were really hard and confusing! would NEVER take her class again ", "Go to her lecture, and expect to learn nothing. She is advertising her office hour all the time and teach nothing in class. In tests she gives you a lot of unreasonable questions asking you to memorize everything like researcher's names. She does train you to learn everything by yourself and how to get good grades. I guess can be good and bad. ", " I like how Kajiura took me out of my comfort zone and encouraged me to take responsibility for my learning. By being more focused and self- disciplined , I now work better and solve problems with more confidence.   My only regret is that I should have visited her office hours sooner. Like my CA said, she's a great prof and very helpful. ", "Dr. Kajiura made going to lectures interesting,. can't believe how much I've learnt from her. I wasn't into Bio before I took this course, but now I am.  Her study questions are a big help, so are her study tips , since I'm  better with managing my time.", "Her lectures help me identify and focus on the important concepts. She is clear about what is testable information for  midterms and exam. With all the material we have to know I appreciated that she shared study tips. ", "She doesnt really teach that well in class. She spends more time talking about what you should know instead of what the actual content is. Like she keeps saying this is the way you should study and so on. ", "Like the lectures. Full of enthusiasm at 8:30. Wonderful!", "Enthusiastic prof. Like her case studies. Tests are tough, but fair.  ", "She's a nice person but her classes are a little dull. I have a hard time staying awake... ", "Excellent professor!  Has high expectations for students to study hard and prepare for tutorials, lectures, and tests.  Her study tips work and finding out about her research was inspiring as I participated in the IMPACT Project that helped , Brad, who had suffered from a stroke. ", "Great prof! Definitely changed my perspective regarding biology and how everything relates to it. I followed her study tips and did well. ", "very nice person, does a lot around the community! but would not want her as a prof... would not take the course again. ", "As I reflect upon my studies at McMaster University, I am grateful for Dr Kajiura having been my mentor.  I know that my next stage in graduate school will be exciting with new challenges and opportunities, I will embrace them since I feel confident that I have the research skills to succeed, thanks to Dr K! ", "Dr Kajiura is very helpful prof. She answered all of my emails and these were numerous!!! I should have followed her advice earlier, finally did and I got better marks.   ", "My fave course and prof first term. Course exposed me to the relevance of Biology. Course requires lots of skills, teaches work ethic.  I liked being motivated to high expectations.", "Great prof. Liked the topics especially the real world examples and case studies.  ", "She honestly does everything in her power to give you all the resources you need. She truly cares about her students and its really sweet. She couldn't make biology interesting for me though. I don't think anyone can. ", "I'm going into my 4th year and she is still one of the best professors I've had! Very passionate and interesting! Her note outlines are very helpful", "She makes bio interesting and is clear about what we're expected to know like applying concepts.", "enjoying 1a03 lectures, they're at 8:30am and I haven't missed any of them since the lectures are so interesting, pace has been good. iClickers are helpful", "I like how Dr Kajura teaches using several sources for her lectures such as videos, case studies, real world examples. Not sure about the previous posting, since she told us on 1st day of lectures that we would be reading only certain sections of the textbook, def NOT the whole thing. She helps a lot during her office hours.", "Dr. Kajuira has her heart in the right place but she manages to spend more time telling us how to do well in her course than actually teaching course content. She assigns too much reading (the entire textbook basically). She does a good job of elucidating the thematic content of the course.", "enjoyed her course very much but what impresses me the most is her humanitarian work and she is humble about that", "really great prof, made me love bio, really cares for her students", "She is one of the few profs who have inspired me to think beyond myself  and how I can contribute to the future of humanity. The biology-related knowledge that she has helped me to gain has provided me with these skills.", "Bio 1M03 opened my eyes to how important Biology is. The case based study approach that Dr K uses challenged me to take ownership over my learning. I rose to her high expectations for us to grasp the course concepts. I now can confidently apply concept to problem solve. A skill that was honed in this course, thanks to Dr K", "So kind :). She was so caring towards the students and definitely wanted everyone to do well. Her style of teaching keeps you interested in lectures, and a lot of the times I didn't realize how quickly time flew by! She includes videos and applications to relate the course material to the world around us, and it keeps you engaged. Solid prof.", "Great Prof. Recommend Her.", "Liked Dr Kajiura's part of 1a03. I think her real-world examples helped me retain the material being taught because I had to put it into practice. No problem with high expectations good prep for next year.", "Great prof, love her teaching style ,she posted questions early which motivated me to start working way in advance of the midterm  amount of work was just right.", "great teacher. kept things very interesting. she actually cares about what shes teaching. she is there for the students. overall she was my favourite prof at mac, but she overwhelms you on midterms and tests. i havent wrote any tests yet but there is so much to know, i wish she would cut that down. but anyways, still a great prof", "amazing prof she cared about us & how we did in the course & what we got from it, real life examples were sooo helpful", "Very much enjoyed Dr Kajiura's lectures. I have  a new-found love for biology and found the information was made relevant and interesting. She engaged me as a student with her methods of teaching and motivated me to succeed in my studies. I now want to learn about all the diverse fields of biology.", "even though sometimes she might not be very clear on what she is exactly saying, she still has a great level of teaching. she is very organized and plans everything ahead of time. she provides the students with chapter outlines which can easily become helpful notes.", "I attended everyone of Dr Kajiura lectures. Loved them!!! She's very organized, approachable, and friendly. I wasn't worried about asking her questions during lectures. The supplementary resources were good too. her practice questions & homework it showed me how to study better.", "She was so nice! She made my first term at Mac better!", "Kajiura used a lot of real-world examples during lectures that were very interesting and relevant to the course material. She always encouraged class discussions and she was very clear in her expectations. Great prof and very friendly outside of class as well!", "I've learnt so much in every bio class. I like how her classes are interesting,fun & interactive.", "Very interested in what she teaches, which makes me even more interested in biology! But she overuses the word &quot;inside&quot; rather than &quot;in.&quot;  ex: &quot;you will find this diagram inside the textbook ...&quot;", "When Steve Jobs died we were all sad, Dr Kajiura helped us by relating the course topics to his pancreatic cancer and that gave us hope for potential research and cures. That was an inspiring lecture.", "This professor was literally the best professor that I have had at McMaster as of yet. She really cares about her students and will do anything thing she can to help them, as long as you as her in person for help. She made this course even more enjoyable for me, though I already loved the course. She has lecture outlines to follow and puts them up.", "I like this course a lot, class notes are really nicely organized, topics esp. medical conditions are interesting. I can tell that Dr. Kajiura enjoys teaches us : )", "4L03 is amazing.Best organized course by far, workload is tough but well worth it.", "As a special needs student (auditory), she  makes me feel welcomed at McMaster. I feel less worried  now. Thks Dr K", "Her teaching style suits me. Nice that she lets me ask questions in class and answers all of my questions after class...lol even when I saw her in bookstore. I asked her about transgenic mice research sounds complex & interesting!!!", "Really friendly prof. I like how Dr K links class topics together with research.", "Thrilled to have Dr K. Went to her office hours this week and she was a tremendous help. She's great to talk to, which is a blessing and appreciated :)", "Excellent course! I've learnt valuable research skills on two levels: group and self-directed.So grateful to have experienced her mentorship.", "I'm a teaching assistant for this course and attend her lectures. Dr. K asked the class about &quot;DNA Bioinformatics&quot; (not DNA), thought I mentioned that since I noticed that an earlier post was incorrect.   I've enjoyed having her as a prof and mentor.", "I'm really surprised that more people are not commenting on her extremely patronizing demeanour. I've only had two classes so far, but she actually asked the class if anyone had ever HEARD of DNA. I was insulted as much as I was laughing. Crazy.", "I appreciated how she genuinely cared about us in 1st yr", "I found 1m03 lessons easier to learn.  Dr K made learning Hardy Weinberg way more meaningful.", "She's soooo helpful with career advice.", "I recommend this course. It prepares you for research & grad school.", "Spring course was really intense, but seriously good. Kajura made bio fun to learn. LOL I'm &quot;an informed scientific citizen&quot; now!!!", "Her lectures and outlines are very helpful. I really enjoyed the real-world examples she provided as it helped me connect with the concepts.  I went to her office hours and she was very helpful in further explaining difficult concepts to me in a new way than she had done in lecture, which shows she really can TEACH!", "I loved this course that dr K taught. It had everything!!! Best moment was the our Research Team's seminar presentation. Dr Kajiura was always there to guide us, Lol even on weekends.", "I just graduated last week. Sooo grateful to have had a prof like Dr Kajiura for 3 undergrad courses. 4L03 was my capstone experience!", "I will keep this review completely neutral so as not to incur the wrath of those who would not see anything unfavourable said about the professor in question. Biology is moderately difficult. Kajiura is moderately good. The course was moderately interesting, moderately difficult, and moderately stimulating.", "I like her teaching style...bio is not easy its challenging and interesting,  I'm not exactly a morning person, but I attended all of her summer classes and enjoyed them. I listened to her advice and was able to land a lab position.", "1. Bio is NOT the hardest course in first year. Try first year chemistry, any artsci or isci course, or first year physics. 2. Kajiura is the worst prof I have ever had. She spoon-feeds her students and treats them like they are in grade 9.", "Although everyone knows bio is the hardest course in 1st year, it was my fave class and subject, outlines and suppl stuff are organized  it was fun attending Dr Ks lectures.

questions. Lectures are good. Does not let us know how much each tutorial weight, nor how much does fianl weight until the end of the semester.", "Well... To start with, the class is entertaining but I found also it is very disorganized. He will show you a quite of few models and provide opportunities for you to try in class. Lots of reading, assignment and quizzes. I wouldn't take this course if it wasn't required course but unfortunately it is.... Good luck for it!", "Difficult class. Learned a lot and really remember most of it. lectures are entertaining.

On the rare occasion that he admits to his mistake he refuses to rectify his error because \"it would take a lot of work and it wouldn't make a big change\"", "Although he can be confusing at times, it works for him. There is a method to the madness and in the end I became a better student. His LIFE revolves around the success of his students. He really cares and wants all his students to succeed.

However, don't take his classes unless you want to be part of an experiment. ", "The  most arrogant prof I've ever had... Super full of himself!!

Really heavy workload, though.", "Awesome prof, very interesting lectures, but his tests are hard (although manageable) so study hard for them!", "Amazing course. You rely learn skills-writing and presenting. Cue cards rock!  The lectures are cool and the tests reasonable. Lots of fun.", "Very interesting class. The material will keep you coming back.

Lectures are dynamic and exciting. The textbook is very dry and not used much.  Tests are very hard, but listen in lecture and you can guess most of the material.

The quizzes are a joke, but the tests are very hard!  He is really interested in helping people, so go up and talk to him.  I did and it totally changed my attitude in the course.

Overall an excellent experience if you're up for it.", "quite difficult, even if you attend class and read the textbook.  quizzes and assignments are easy, but midterms + final exam aren't.  the class itself though, is interesting and dr. shore prepares fascinating lectures/demos.", "Man this guy is so full of himself i want to vomit. This class is pure memorization of mountains of cases and graphs from studies from decades ago. lame self-endorsing stories,sets a quiz standard but constantly cancels or alters marking scheme for worst. if you try planning for which quzies you want to take/miss he will screw you over by cancelling quizes day of ( best 7/ 11 some people miss a quiz but get screwed when he cancels next weeks as well ) .unorganized. gone a lot, hard to get help or get in contact with. Other prof's tests are 100 times easier with no graph memorization or much regergetation required. take the other cog prof . way better and easier.", "this is NOT an easy class. there is ALOT of material that is covered.

There are ALOT of experiments, some are interesting while others are boring.", "Podcasts are awesome.  Thanks for all of the hard work!  The textbook was not used.  Lectures are great. dynamic, energetic, clear.  The tests are hard, but managable if you attend class. He never tests on the textbook other than in quizzes which are a brease.  Overall I learned a lot.", "Hard tests. Shore is a good teacher though, if you come to class and tutorials you can usually tell what is going to be on the midterms.", "Often doesn't know the answers to his own multiple choice quiz and/or exam questions when taking up answers. Poor or illogically phrased questions frequent. Lucky he has good TAs which provide excellent study notes. Lots of graph questions. Mixes up concepts, but otherwise good public speaker. Still overall taking this course is not worth it.", "The last student is wacked. Shore is clear and tells you all of the questions on the tests and even some of the answers. You just have to attend class and listen!  Obviously, the previous student did poorly on the last test--a real zinger, but other than the multiple choice totally fair!", "Probably one of the worst prof's I have ever had. He knows his stuff, but cannot communicate it in a way that facilitates and correlates his exams. Terrible. RETIRE!", "TOUGH", "When I first took the class I thought it was a doozy, however towards the end I quite enjoyed it. Dr. Shore knows his stuff and is a great professor, but his exams are a little tough. Overall though a great course and very helpful TAs.", "amazing demos", "Dr. Shore taught an extremely difficult class with confusing material, however, I loved every part of it.  The tests were hard, but they asked questions in really different ways, rather than just relying on multiple choice.  I think most ppl didn't like being asked to think about and reinterpret the material, too much thinking involved i guess.", "He is a prof that teaches tough material. I think he did a good job of it. Although his lectures totally have a lot of info, he basically tells you what will be on his exams", "Dr.Shore is a great prof!!! He explains things very well and is willing to answer questions. I really liked taking his class and suggest other students take 2H03.", "Dr. Shore is hard, but takes feedback and modified the test in response to feedback.  The last person clearly has sour grapes because she did not do well.  This is a fun course where you learn lots", "Avoid Shore if possible. Tests are rediculously hard, esp. for a 2nd year intro course. Crams in way too much info and experiments. It all just gets lost on you. He is also rather indifferent to student feedback regarding tests and assignments. Looks like George Costanza, so at least you'll have that to laugh about... and that's about it.", "OH MY GOD!!!short is HORRIBLE, and whats up w/ the tests&#63; He is THE WORST PROF EVER!", "He was way too hard. Unreasonably tough.", "Good stuff!  Dr. Shore had high expectations and cares about what his students know.  I totally respect him for it.", "Shore is the worst professor in all canadian universities. He should not be a teacher. He gives impossible exams. His course homepage will indicate how low the grades in his class are.", "This guy is the hardest prof at McMaster. That is a guarantee. DONOT enrol in any class he teaches. You have been warned! His class average is always extremely low. He apparently went to some gifted highschool and thinks all students at McMaster are equally gifted as he was. Terrible and awful prof.", "These previous comments don't know what they are talking about.  Dr. Shore gives great lectures. Interesting, engaging, and full of good demos.  His tests suck!  Way too hard.  I leared lots but almost failed the course.", "Most terrible prof ever!!!", "I'm glad he knew what he was talking about because I sure didn't. He raced through the material and there were no questions in class. The final exam was a head shaker and he was the worst prof I have ever had at Mac.", "Tests were extremely hard. What the correct answers were supposed to be were poorly explained, therefore improvement was pretty much impossible. Experiment question on final exam was stupid and shouldn't be worth 2%. Questions were too specific and didn't allow for elaboration. I am very disappointe", "Horrible prof.", "Course material and lectures are really interesting. If you are willing to work hard than it is possible to do well on his tests!

Tough and LONG tests.  He's a good guy who is willing explain things if you're lost. Not my most favourite class, but of the 2 profs who split this class (him & Dr. Brooks) he was better.

Extremely passionate about his work though, which is admirable.", "No Comments", "I cant understand why the tests are so hard!", "It's true..he is VERY smart and knows how to explain stuff so that you understand it..but I find this only when you talk to him one-on-one.

He has insightful readings of the texts and is quite helpful if you see him for assistance.  I really enjoyed the texts that he chose to work with and the workload was reasonable.", "The tenure system at its best: he teaches 2 courses a year, gets nearly six months off, makes $150K, has research assistants to do his work, is an atrocious scholar, never shows up to class, and, finally, is the most selfish and small-minded man I have ever had the misfortune of studying under.  &quot;Third rate--at best,&quot; to quote his oft used phrase.", "At first he can seem rather intimidating, but don't be scared!  When I was having trouble with my final paper, I approached him and he was eager to help.  A very smart, friendly, approachable prof.  Don't expect easy marks though!  He also makes you work hard on the exam, no easy rhetorical questions folks! ;)", "6 weeks of unbelievably boring student presentations. he hardly lectured, and when he did he was constantly name dropping.. talking about the authors he personally knows. lectures were the biggest waste of time - didnt learn a thing. seemed like he didn't want to be there. hated this class and do not recommend taking a course with him", "DISTINGUISHED PROFESSOR&#63;&#63; NO WAY!!!", "I dreaded his lectures each week. He would cancel classes for now reason and we had 6 weeks of student presentations. Super boring. He would talk about his accomplishments in life and how much he hated mcmaster. We had maybe 10 lectures in a full year class. Its almost as if he didnt want to teach.", "The pure disinterest of this professor was astonishing. He joins the club of &quot;worst professors at McMaster.&quot; Aside from cancelling class for whole weeks at a time throughout semester, he spent the remaining time talking about his assorted accomplishments in life or arbitrarily grading papers that I don't believe he had read. Never once lectured.", "I loved this class, he did not tarnish the high regard I already had for Jane Austen, which a crap prof might have done.

is the GOAT. He is my favourite professor so far and honestly he cares about all 1000 of his students. I even watched his videos on youtube. I love this guy. Coming out of high school I didn't love math, but he made math interesting to learn. The content is not too difficult, show up to class and tutorials, study well and you'll do fine.", "Miroslav is a legend. He is hilarious without even trying and his quirkiness is lovable. Fantastic prof and the tests were all very based on assignments and previous practise tests. Extremely easy to do well if you go to class and keep up. Miroslav is actually my favourite and he cares so much about students. He's a gem y'all!!", "This is one of the best profs at Mac. Beats everyone else by a long shot. He's so kind and humble, and really cares about the students. Super easy to approach and helpful. Would take all my courses with him if I could.", "simply AMzing", "Amazing professor, best course I have taken so far and would recommend it to anyone- truly is the best math course that can help with real life ! Very caring and tries his very best to make sure everyone has a good enough understanding of the concepts. His attitude towards math and his professionalism is truly inspirational !", "Will continue to be one of the profs at Mac that truly care about the success of the students and makes the content interesting & understandable.", "Amazing professor. Would love to take another class with him.", "How did it feel to hold a Koala and look like it too?", "Favourite Prof at Mac so far! really nice and approachable made the concepts easier to understand would  definitely recommend taking one of his courses", "Nice guy. Makes a lot of funny comments. Tries to really explain concepts. However, he all over the place during the lecture and is kind of hard to follow along. His midterms were straight from the homework assignments, which i should have done..  no wonder i failed the course.", "Probably my favourite professor so far! Absolutely amazing guy! He really cares about his students and  is funny too. Easy to talk to and explains things very well and a lot of the testing was similar to the homework assignments!", "He is the nicest!!he is one of the best prof in math, not like some new stupid prof this year urhh", "He's amazing", "Dr. Lovric is wonderful. He explains math concepts extremely well and doesn't skip steps when doing calculations. He's very approachable and doesn't make you feel stupid when you ask a question. Make sure you do all the homework assignments because very similar/the same questions will appear on the tests!", "Lovric is one of the nicest, most wonderful profs I've ever had. He's easy to listen to and really tries to get the concepts across effectively. The class is pretty condensed so if you miss a lecture, you really do fall behind. I highly recommend you go to tutorials aswell, you go through a lot of examples, many similar to the ones on the midterms.", "He's a really good prof. Makes the learning environment during lectures so stress free and helps so much with explaining his steps as he goes through problems.", "He makes every concept so easy to understand. his test questions were similar to the homework assignments. so if you do all of them, you're most likely to do well in his class.", "God amongst men.", "Dr. Lovric was one of my favourite profs in first year. He's really nice and funny and he clearly cares about his students. His lectures are very clear and prepare you well for the tests. ", "MATH 3G03 is a great class. The assignments are tricky, but very doable and rewarding. Miroslav recognizes students will work together to solve the problems, but definitely take the time to sort out the concepts for your own benefit. The course will give you good intuition for problem solving in mathematics, especially through computer programming.", "He's the best professor ever. My life is not complete without him. 3", "Problem Solving was an easy course. Lovric's approach to problem solving makes learning problem solving easy. Great lecturer, learned some cool things, lots of neat tricks which were helpful in other classes. Many assignments. Both tests and the exam were take-home. There was no text book. Great class!", "Another prof told me that he is the best teacher of math in the department - that is why they always put him with the first years. He is. Easily the best TEACHER of mathematics. Tests are easy. He said he tested poorly as a student, so he often gives take home tests and many assignments. Stresses heuristic and problem solving - great for math.", "Very willing to help students and gives very clear explanations. Everyone loves Lovric :)", "Amazing guy. Best prof I've ever had so far. He's fun and knows how to teach. Even though English is probably his second language, he can explain material a lot better than other professors whose first language is English. ", "Lovric is an incredible prof. His lectures are very clear and he does his best to make sure that his students understand the content. Definitely one of the best profs I've had in first year.   He is a naturally funny and adorable man who manages to maintain my attention during classes. Everyone loves Lovric. :)", "One of my favourite profs in first year. His lectures are as fun as math can be and he cares for his students. He's great at explaining concepts so I found his lectures helpful.  ", "The best prof at Mac. He explains so well and he is so caring about his students. ", "BEST PROFESSOR IN MAC!!! Love his lectures, he makes hard knowledge easy to understand. Tests are easier than assignments and practise test covers everything on test. His classes are REALLY worth taking.", "Best professor in the school. Hands down.", "BEST PROF YOU WILL EVER HAVE!", "really good prof.  teaches proofs very well.  midterms are fairly lengthy, but fair.", "This man is amazing. He cares sooo much about his students and he goes out of his way to make sure everyone is happy. He uses the classic overheads and it may seem a bit confusing at first however it really works well and he provides you with good and clear explanations. If I could I would switch to do a math major/thesis under him!", "Awesome guy, great teacher. Do not know how anyone can dislike him", "Absolutely incredible guy. So helpful, loves his subjects and genuinely cares about all his students.", "Best professor at the university and it's not even close. Takes time to ensure you understand what is going on and does whatever he can to help as long as you ask. He was awesome!", "Amazing Prof. Naturally funny. He knows what he is teaching. Happy that I was in his class.", "Def cares for his students. Its possible to get As in his class as long as you study hard for his quizzes and tests by practicing those assignments.", "Probably the best math prof in the university.", "Lovric was a very good prof. Although most of the material was high school review, he made the class very interesting to attend. His tests were very reasonable and he cares for the students. This class is an easy 12 if you did well in high school Calculus.", "Best prof at Mac!!! He makes the hard stuff look doable. Hoping he teaches higher level math courses!! :D", "he is probably the best professor  at mcmaster university, the best i ever had, he makes difficult thing easier to understand; you can tell he loves what he does and really wants the student to understand and like his class;  he will always be open for questions... he will ask you for feedback", "He is a good prof, but quite overrated.  Sometimes he fails to communicate important information that would greatly help student understanding.  Very informal teaching style, but very learnable.  Funny prof; tests and quizzes are difficult, but the assignments really help.  If you don't spend a lot of time studying/practicing, you may", "Definately recommended! Notes are clear and concise, with lots of relevant examples. Very friendly and helpful during extra-help sessions. Didn't used to textbook that much, but still good for review. Overall, excellent professor! Take his class if you get the chance!", "Absolutely incredible prof. Very clear, organized helpful and actually cares about his students and wants them to do well. Best prof I have had so far.", "One of the better professors I have had thus far.  Very clear with his explanations, and very thorough with concepts.  A good sense of humour as well.", "Best professor/teacher I have ever had in my entire life. Having him made me consider majoring in math just so I could have him again. Genuinely cares about his students and is amazing at explaining difficult concepts. He made me see math in a new light. You are so lucky if you get this professor!!!!", "Definitely one of my favourite professors. So glad I had him for this class! He is the cutest man ever, and so unintentionally hilarious. The tests and exam seemed fair. TAKE HIS CLASS!!", "Deserves to win professor of the year. AMAZING TEACHING STYLE.", "My favorite professor so far. Very clear and concise, uses overhead notes unlike most profs who use power-points. Fairly easy course, tests accurately resemble homework assignments.", "Dr. Lovric is an outstanding and brilliant math teacher. He goes through problems one step at a time which really helps everyone understand. By far my best prof for first year. You will be so lucky if you get him!!", "consider yourself blessed if you get lovric as your prof. the way he uses overheads instead of powerpoints means that he can work through questions with the class. you can follow along as he explains and does the problems. he is very clear and very good at explaining concepts. he is also very funny (even through he doesn't try to be!) AMAZING!", "What a boss... lectures are well detailed, clear, and concise. Is there anything more you want&#63;", "Amazing professor", "There isn't anyone who doesn't like Lovric. Clear, funny, and knows his stuff", "Lovric was probably one of my favourite first year profs. Although the accent did take a while to get used to, by the end I loved it! He's funny and good at what he does. If you pay attention in class and actually study for tests you'll do really well! :)", "He doesn't try to be funny...he just is! Does a very good job in explaining concepts.", "cutest man ever!", "Great professor", "I had him for 2X and 2XX I loved this prof. I nominate him to become the future president of McMaster University. Most intelligent man I have ever seen. His love for calculus is infectious and it rubs on students. Very easy to do well in his courses. Just do all the homework and understand every one of the examples in his text. Study. Guaranteed A-", "He is the only teacher I've had that has explained math in a way that made sense to me.  He's a fantastic prof -- enrol in his section for sure!", "Dr. Lovric did a great job in both lectures and tutorials. Reflecting on previous comments, I imagine that supervising a graduate course of 10 students would require less expertise than organizing a large first year class where you must recognize and reconcile differences in backgrounds and deliver a course even non-math majors will find valuable.", "Unbelievable Prof. He was so amazing. He has this aura and his voice is so so sexy! Love his accent. His tests and exams are totally fair and no surprises. Just do all the practice questions that he assigns and understand them carefully, and you will have no problem getting atleast A- in his course. Sometimes the final can be a little long though.", "GREAT", "he is an awesome prof who really gets the concepts through to the class.", "He is a great prof, and hilarious too!", "Min-Oo is the man. He taught every prof in the math department what he or she knows today, especially Dr Lovric. I really hope Dr Lovric appreciates the man they call Min-Oo.", "I agree with most of the previous comments. Dr. Lovric is a good man, but from a fairness perspective, I have to be honest and say Maung Minoo is far more knowledgeable. Lovric is here at Mac today because of Minoo. Lovric should consider Minoo to be his mentor and develop a more live and spontaneous teaching style the way Minoo does it.", "The textbook Lovric wrote for vector calculus is very bad. It has poor examples. Dr. Minoo is not using the textbook Lovric wrote for Math2X03 because he knows what is better for students. Minoo deserves to get all the hot girls going after him. Girls are wrong in liking Lovric. Minoo is far better looking and has better personality then Lovric.", "Fairly good prof but not as great as Dr. minoo. He should consider minoo as his role model and hone his teaching skills by following minoo's teaching style. He is not as great a mathematician as minoo is.", "Amazing professor. I agree with the previous comments. He teaches very difficult courses. Some of the most challenging courses are taught by Professor Lovric, so he deserves all the prestige and awards that he receives. His courses like Math 1LS3 are more difficult then Real Analysis or Partial Differential Equations. I got A+ from him twice.", "Such a great professor. He really knows his stuff inside out and can solve any math problem you throw at him, on the spot. He is a serious mathematician. He teaches some of the most difficult/challenging courses at McMaster (like math 1LS3, Math 2X03, Math 1A03) These courses are for very high I.Q students. He has very busy schedule. Amazing prof.", "wowowow amazing prof. he was my life!", "If you want to open the doors to your future, take a course taught by this professor. If you want to permanently lock the doors to your future, take Chris McLean's courses. You will know the difference. This prof is quiet fair. He had a really nasty TA once upon a time, but generally speaking his exams are similar to practice problems in the book.", "Excellent professor. He can answer any first year calculus question, but beyond that he gets into trouble. However, he is very caring. He will cuddle girls whenever they are stressed. Tries to make them feel comfortable around him. That really helps.", "No Comments", "Lectures are interesting and concepts are clearly explained with excellent examples. Prof is helpful, thoughtful, and puts alot of effort into the course. Alot of ridiculous, immature comments here with zero relativity to the effectiveness as this professor as an instructor.", "Very Tough Professor", "He teaches first year calculus. He MUST be a genius. That stuff is SOOOOO hard.", "he was a great prof, funny too!", "Excellent. I hope to be like him one day. I love his first name &quot;MIROSLAV&quot;", "Dr. Lovric was the best professor I have ever had. He is well organized and explains his material well.", "Good prof. Has good intentions for his class. Do all the homework and should be good enough.", "Awesome professor", "He kind of looks like Andrei Arlovski with long grey hair. Best prof ever btw", "No Comments", "i love him! he is so funny :D", "Don't bother attending his lectures; you learn almost nothing from him. I hear he's won teaching awards. In my opinion he should do what's right and give them back.", "This prof taught me that 3 minus 3 is zero during lecture. He is professor of the year for sure!!", "I had him some time back for Math 1A03. He was great. Thanks for the good mark.", "He taught me that the derivative of any constant is zero. This prof clearly has a high IQ!", "WHY DOES he ask Definition questions on the test 2&#63; This is a MATH COURSE not an English course where you have to test the student has memorized the definition. Ridiciulous!", "Amazing Prof. That's all I have to say.", "GREAT PROFESSOR!", "He is the best prof I have ever had! His lessons were engaging and he captures his audience attention extremely well. He has very good advice and is a patient, good hearted man. His TA memtick was however a VERY VERY miserable human being.", "I had him couple years back. He was really good prof but his TA was so awful, I dont remember his name but he was some guy with a horrible accent and condescending attitude I think he was Turkish guy he's not at McMaster anymore", "Amazing professor. I have learnt so much from him. I learnt about logarithms, sketching the graphs of functions, trigonometry etc etc. This stuff was very scary for me before but he taught in a manner that I really understood what's happening behind the scenes. I hope to get atleast A in this course. Best prof for any first year calculus courses.", "the test was hard", "He is a good man. Know the textbook inside out.", "Professor has great style to teach.", "The term has just started but I am liking him very much already. The first quiz was very easy.", "One of the best profs seen till now. As a person he is very nice. Much better then his TA Mehmetcik. The key to doing well in his class is know how to do each and every homework problem that he assigned and memorize the solutions to all the examples he told you to study from the textbook. Exams are very similar to homework problems. Hard to get A+", "OUTSTANDING proffff", "He is the best math professor I ever had! He makes lessons very interesting, lots of advice and very approachable. For calc 1A03, don't miss out on him and as long as you do the questions from the coursework, you'll do just fine. best part - he is just  hilarious!!", "Great prof. He wrote the textbook so he loves it and uses gets majority of exams questions from the text only. Strongly recommend him for 2X3 and 2XX3", "He is the most helpful professor I met in my first year. He would always be happy to help you if you have trouble understanding the material.", "Really cares about students", "Outstanding teaching performance.", "He is the best professor ever.

Make sure you memorize all the questions that he assigned.", "BEST.PROF.EVER", "Overall excellent professor", "Very very good professor", "He is the most fair prof in the math department. Takes his job seriously, answers emails prompty and cares for all the students.", "HE IS VERY NICE MAN. IF YOU DID ALL THE HOMEWORK PROBLEMS HE ASSIGNED EACH AND EVERY QUESTION THEN YOU ARE PRETTY MUCH GUARANTEED ATLEAST A- IN HIS COURSES", "Amazing. Take his class, and don't be afraid to go to this man for help. He really just wants everyone to do well. Weekly quizes keep you on track, and can boost your mark as long as you prepare.", "He is a good professor. Explains very good.", "EXCELLENT!!", "Professor Lovric was awesome for Math 2x03 and then again awesome for Math 2XX3. His tests were tough but fair. Good teaching style.", "Amazing.Best prof ever.", "He is great teacher.", "AMAZING prof, always asked us &quot;are you happy with this&#63;&quot;", "Good prof; Hard though...", "I am not a math student, I detest calculus, and yet I loved the first year ArtSci calculus class I took with Dr. Lovric! He is amazing, passionate, and helpful as a teacher. I have not continued in math, but I appreciate all that Dr. Lovric taught me. Certainly not for the fainthearted, but worth every second if you're willing to work also!", "he goes extremely slowly throughout the term, and towards the end of the semester when he still has so much to cover, he targets to cover 2 sections per day, which is 4 times his normal speed. That does not make him a great prof!!!!! If he was a great prof, he wouldn't speed through the material in the end, just to get it done. Think about it.", "Terrible Prof", "EXCELLENT", "Nice prof. He lectures at a perfect pace and does not rush to cover all the material.", "Best prof in math. In response to the comment below it would mean girls are his dear, and boys are not his dear. Does anybody know if he favours girls more than guys&#63; He is very smart and teaches efficiently and clearly.", "He says &quot;Thank You&quot; at the end of every lecture", "Make the tests easier please!!", "He is very sexy and good looking prof although his tests are hard as hell. Theoretical questions requiring intuition are asked. His tests will slaughter you nicely. He is WAYYYYYYYYYY harder than Dr. Alama who taught math 2xx3 last year. Wish Dr. Alama taught math 2x03 and 2XX3 this year!! Would have been so much easier!!!!", "Awesome", "Math 2X03 and 2XX3--- VERY TOUGH PROFESSOR", "LOVE HIM", "He is polite and courteous.", "Lovric had time on his hands, so he mathematically proved to us that vampires don't exist because if they did, they would consume us all in about 32 weeks.

He cares about his students and answers e-mails very quickly. And he's absolutely halirious; if you go to his lectures you will have a blast!

Absolutely adorable when confused, too. haha.", "Seriously, Dr. Lovric's explanations are simply the best (you really gotta attend his lectures to truly understand what I mean).

The midterm and exam are fair outwise", "The course content itself is light, a lot of it is common sense (i.e. Business terms and concepts) but you my friend, you're in Rita Cossa's class! The 10% report is absolutely brutal and unnecessarily toughly graded.  She started the semester off by praising herself and her abilities in school, if the annoying teacher's pet became a prof, its her.", "I love her. I have so much respect for her as a person and as a professional. I was scared to take the course with her because of my experience in 1E03, but I now realize that what she does in that course teaches attention to detail and following instructions.", "One of the worst teachers and courses I have taken in my academic career. I have learned nothing from her. The course should be called how to write citations and not Business Environment. It has done nothing for me accept add stress and useless assignments to my already heavy workload.", "I dont get how people are saying her lectures are \"well structured\" when she spends half the class talking about student feedback, why shes choosing to ignore it, and then reads directly off the slides for rest. She claims that she cares but she never accepts feedback. Guys dont get fooled. Needless to say, loads of work on useless material.", "To be fair, Cossa does have really well structured lectures but she is incredibly nit-picky about things. Most of the tutorial work is worth nothing but if you don't do it, you get deductions. If you don't wear the proper attire for presentations (even if just 1 article is off), deductions. Still not really sure what the course is about. Good luck.", "\"1% deduction\"", "Rita is very personable and you can see that she genuinely cares about students and their performance.

As a lecturer she is rude, I was using my laptop and transitioning from another courses notes to her notes through the university website and she asked me to get off my laptop.", "Still don't know what the course is really about", "Not bad. Do your work, read the textbook, and the tests aren't too bad.", "Not a easy marker, don't expect easy tests/quiz/exams neither, lectures are just reading her ppt, need to read your textbook.

Bunk prof", "Professor Cossa was easily one of my favorite professors in my 1st year at McMaster. She is both passionate about the course material and genuinely wants to see her students succeed. Also, her tests are quite fair. The difficult parts of this course involved the group projects (but they are worth little overall). Hint: read the textbook!", "A lot of people get scared of Cossa because of this class. First of all, she is a super nice person.

Yes, she demands a lot, but this is University.", "As a first year, I found this class to be extremely demanding and time consuming in comparison with my other courses. At times, she can be demotivating and condescending during lecture therefore leading to my lack of interest in attending class. Reports are graded harshly and only focus on formatting which is the least important component", "Many people do not like her because she is very demanding and expects a lot from her students. I thought she was a very good professor. The class requires a lot of effort and work, but she is very clear of her expectations and you must put in the work to succeed. Reading textbook is a must,she wrote it. Id take one of her classes again in future.", "Ridiculously picky marker. Her multiple choice tests questions were confusing.

Her mid-term tests and exams were very fair and overall she is a good teacher.", "Her teaching style is great! You don't HAVE to show up but you really should.

No other prof spells out EXACTLY what she wants for full grades. Memorize the textbook, and you will ace the exams. Find a good group, and you will ace the reports.

Sure she uses the textbook a lot, and marks pretty hard.. but come on, she askss you exactly what she wants... so what do you expect. its freaking university not college. :P", "prof will take off points for the spelling/formate error and you could ended up getting zero for the major project/assignment", "a word of advice for a A+: MEMORIZE THE ENTIRE TEXTBOOK!! even if you fail the report/proposal because of bad partners, being more familiar than her with the textbook will save your grade", "Took her course 2 years ago, and hated every minute of it. But seriously, go into her class with an open mind and don't listen to all the negative comments. Sure, her reports are killer, but when you get to 3rd/4th year you realize that they her reports are VERY valuable and wish more profs gave such clear guidelines. SHE'S GREAT!", "The assignments got better than first year/ but the group assignments can still cause a bad mark if you get stuck with idiots in your group.

Her tests are fair if you study but the report is what really screws you over! i personally think this course was a bit hard to be a first year course all thanks to proffessor COSA so good luck all first years!", "Everytime i tell someone about this prof/class they think her class and expectations are ridiculous. These are people who have been through university themselves too! There are some nice, and useful parts. Work hard, and you'll still do fine, it just won't be very much fun.", "hard professor, especially the first year report where people get negative numbers below zero on it. tests are fair though if you study, its straight from the textbook", "blah", "She's on a major power trip.  She needs to stop over using her authority, and demeaning students by making them feel worthless with her pointless nitpicking on minor formatting errors.", "****", "The course is challenging, namely the report/proposal, but as long as you study hard, you will still end up with a 10/11/12.  Doing badly in the course means that a) you had a horrible group for the report/proposal or b) you're just not the greatest at business, which means you get an early wake-up call to study harder.", "Challenging, but very helpful", "She's a crazy ass teacher who is very strict! Even though i got a high mark from her first proposal, she's really tough! Have fun first year students next year", "brutal teacher", "Her exams questions for the most part lack clarity. She has an aloof marking scheme for the report, and ambiguous expectations for its contents as seemingly fitting research results in a zero mark. And, she punishes those who do not attend class by not including 90% of video lectures to those who miss a class, and the slides are riddled with blanks", "all the good comments stated about her was probably from her!", "im pretty sure she doesn't have a phd and is still teaching as a normal prof...someone should book her for plagiarizing the text", "get a life!!! sits in her office, trying to kick as my people out of commerce as possible but spending at least 2 hours on every report, to see if its sentences matched with any from previous years...GET A LIFE and leave people alone!!!!", "at least 24 hours working on a project to get a negative mark..... her grading scheme is terrible and her tests are basically trivia from the textbook and 0 on application.", "There's a special place reserved in hell.", "Disorganized and unreasonable.

I dare anyone to actually take her class and be able to say she isn't. makes me appreciate my high school profs more.", "she is a horrible prof. she likes to eat the confidence of first year students for breakfast. she expects too much. her project is graded on the stupid 'you start with 100 and lose grades for every mistake scale' and its dumb", "Was a terrible prof. Was condescending and confrontational when disagreed. Would deliberately humiliate students. Her reports would ridiculous in the expectations. Just a terrible prof to have, she's scarred me for life. Her exams were reasonable however.", "she is funny", "There is little you will learn from taking a class with Cossa. Final exam is simply common sense re-worded, and/or useless facts (no theory whatsoever). Arrogant prof.", "Extremely clear about her expectations.

Her expectations are legitimate, just not in a first year course. She needs to give students an adjustment period. Her style should be saved for a fourth year or graduate course when the maturity level has improved. I hope she reads this and takes note.", "She is the most difficult and irritating professor I have ever had, and I'm in engineering! Her obsessiveness when it comes to formatting in assignments is insane (Be prepared to receive a NEGATIVE percentage). While her course is supposed to be just a 2nd-year intro to marketing, she mixes too many upper-year requirements. AVOID HER AT ALL COSTS.", "The thing that most people complain about is the lethal formatting which is decisively killer. Honestly though, if you studied hard for the tests and are able to apply the knowledge, then you should do fine, regardless of your report mark with the formatting marking scheme from the abyss. The lectures made sense and the tests were doable.", "Wow, cossa almost won prof of the year...did h e ll freeze over", "She's a killer....", "Lectures are okay, but marking is horrible. Focuses 10% on quality of work, and 90% on the formatting. You can write a excellent paper, but if you use commas instead of periods in your citation you fail. This nit-picking marking made the class incredibly frustrating and time consuming. Her expectations are clear, but  foolish.", "great prof. u actully learn from her class. and can see urself apply it in the real job field. her instruction n expectations are clear. who ever doesnt do well in her class obviously doenst pay attention. she is very kind and helpful.", "Arrr!!! A very frusterating class indeed.  You work your ass of for formatting and it still doesn't matter because you'll get a zero on it anyway.  Might as well make report all in Times New Roman size 36 and underlined with single spacing.  Other than that the class wasn't terrible.", "tests as you useless questions, useless questions and useless facts. Who cares about statistics....Rita Cossa thats who...should give marks for doing good and not taking away if not attain expectations (sometimes too high)", "Very limited. Cossa encourages work, but not understanding or initiative. Course in general not really very good. Many innacurate, misleading, or just plain useless points/aspects of the course.

You're supposed to give marks for doing a good job, not take all of them away for one mistake.", "No Comments", "No Comments", "Focuses on formatting and disregards content. Basically you fail on formatting before she gets to read what you actually wrote.", "Liked the course.  She brought lots of examples to class and tried to help with the Reports.

Not everyone should be in this program...", "Horrible prof, focuses more on formatting papers than content. skip the text book, learn the chicago manual of style and youll be fine.", "worst, meanest, unfairest lamest, most boring prof in the entire universe!!! yukk hate her a lot...", "this &quot;prof&quot; could potentially be the worst human being on the face of the planet. perhaps if she took her head out of mat\u00e9as @$$ for one second she would realize that she is incredibly unfair and that i am right.", "Despite doing well in her course, I think Cossa is absolutely horrible.

Exams rediculously easy, and have nothing to do with course (anyone with common sense could pass) I am now dumber for taking this course.", "I liked the course and prof. cossa.  She spends a lot of time with students and she is interesting to listen to.  You need to get to tutorials on time.  Too bad there are students that don't pull their own weight in the report.", "Yah the reports are hard, but get used to it Commerce is all about group work. The tests and exam are easy if you go to class and do the reading, it's really simple stuff and she makes it really clear in class.

She also just reads things right off of her slides, anyone can do that haha.", "The actual reports and the way they are marked is insane!

The inconsistency in the way the proposal and the report are ridiculous. She's very strict and expects perfection. The course is interesting but she does not have professor qualities in the social area.", "a Tough teacher that probably won't liked by all, but probably the best prof ever.

Professor has a bad impression of real world work.

Oh and she also accused me of cheating..but i got my marks back in the end.", "Hated her. She is rude, loves to brag and has no time or respect for her students.  I was sick and in the hospital when I was suppose to do my group presentation and she told me I should still participate via phone from my hospital bed! terrible teacher.", "Brags about her extensive education.

Horrible prof.", "Project is hard, but I got like 50% on it and still manged a 10 in the class through her easy M/C tests and exam. The non-cumulative exam is a huge plus.

And the RIGOUROUS training she puts you thru on the reports will definitely help you later on.", "Rita is extremely helpful and she spends a lot of time with her students.

Go to class though because the final exam is on stuff only covered in class.", "Best prof I've had at Mac.", "Grellette is a solid prof. His lectures are probably the best I have experienced as he ties reading material together well, and is incredibly detailed in his explanations - while being entertaining and thought-provoking. Sometimes, he is too quick to dismiss student ideas, but I believe that in a one-on-one setting, he is far more approachable.", "Fantastic professor", "Dr. Grellette is a fantastic professor. Absolutely amazing, engaging lectures, which are clear and build on readings well. His assignments are tough yet realistic. Final exam is always fair if you have attended class.", "He is an amazing professor. He really makes sure to engage all his students and his intentions on what he wishes you to take away are clear.

He is very passionate about his class is was a joy to learn from.", "Is never unclear, and if he is, creates a safe environment for questions to be asked. Clear on marking schemes.

Rigid, fair,realistic, balanced", "Dr. Grellette was the best professor I had in my whole undergraduate degree. He is able to articulate complex issues in a simple, engaging way.

I would recommend taking anything he teaches regardless of the content.", "He was by far the best prof I have ever had in my four years at Mac!

He was pretty busy this semester and asked students not to come to him unless as a last resort. He tried really hard to make skippers do badly, he didn't put a lot of stuff online.", "I had him for two courses- Political Philosophy and Metaphysics & he's got to be my favourite prof at Mac.

He doesn't dwell on things in a way that kills everyone's interest, but he's very careful to make sure everyone understands. Funny, interesting &  a good guy.", "Clear, helpful, and overall a decent professor, but he does have high expectations - after handing back our essays, he flat out said, \"no one got a 90\". He doesn't give super low grades or anything, he just doesn't give super high ones, either. He was also a bit harsh marking the final exam (I'm still bitter about that).Everything else is great. :)", "Amazing. Grellette is more focused on political and legal philosophy from his educational background, I had him for metaphysics, which he admitted was not his best area, but he was fantastic. Lectures were engaging. He made sure every single person understood the material--RARE quality. Super friendly and approachable too! Great guy!", "Very charismatic.

Makes up course names that sound interesting then only talks about germany and the holocaust badly!!

If you pay attention in lecture (and in the lab) and do the readings, you should do great. Super helpful, so if you have any questions, just ask him!", "Very energetic and engaging prof. His lectures are interesting and informative. Only problem I had was that when he would get too excited he would speak quite quickly and I would have a hard time taking down notes. Tutorials were easy and tests/assignments were fair.", "The best professor that i've had to date. He's fun, entertaining, and obviously loves what he does. The exams are easy as long as you study the material. He uses Avenue to post his slides plus his notes on the readings to elaborate on the info. Didn't need to attend all of the lectures but I did because he's such an interesting professor.", "Dr. Carter is a very interesting and dynamic professor. He is very passionate about his work and has many interesting facts to share. However, he can be a bit hard to follow sometimes when he gets excited and starts talking quickly.

This is a very challenging course, and the lectures are fast paced, but he really does all he can to help us all understand the material (ie. Avenue discussion posts = EXCELLENT, and podcasts)", "Dr. Carter is an entertaining professor, his class is very interesting but he has too many negative things to say about other students as well as his co-workers, and he shares this with everyone.", "Dr. Carter is a fantastic professor!

Also, the British accent helps", "A good prof that really wants to help students learn. His midterm was EXTREMELY hard, but exam was a lot more fair.

the book. Although I loved the lectures as he gave specific examples and related the terms and theories so our lives and made them easier to understand and remember.  ", "This class is a hit or miss, I think it just depends on whether you intend on majoring in Communications or not. I loved the class and found Professor Sevigny to be interesting, to be fair everything in lecture is pulled straight from the textbook, but he does add in personal anecdotes. Great prof to have if you want to work in the industry.", "How can you say that Dr. Sevigny says nothing? His experience as a PR pro is extensive and successful. I hung on every word and went to his office - he spent an hour with me talking about politics, PR, my future. Gave me great tips for an internship.", "Really surprised by his high rating and quite disappointed by the fact that many won't believe my rating because it's shrouded by more positive reviews. Extremely boring speaker. Not captivating in the least bit. Like the other reviewer, i stopped attending classes as i found them useless... don't think I learned anything from this class.", "Don't know what the last commenter was thinking. Must have attended a different lecture. This was my best course in my whole first year at Mac. Dr. Sevigny is awesome.", "Really terrible prof. never really said anything important, all material was pulled from the textbook, and most was common sense. I stopped attending lectures because they were a waste of time since the notes were posted online, and he really had nothing to add that was useful.", "Best. Professor. Ever.", "Really enjoying Dr. S\u00e9vigny's 4N03 seminar. He makes it all seem so effortless - doesn't speak from notes, always knows the answer to your question. I really feel that I have learned a lot about agenda setting, framing and the news industry. His guest speakers are great, too.", "he is by far my favorite professor yet.. I love his teaching style, the way he approached the course material and his interaction with the class... I seriously wish we had more like him, he's such a fascinating and knowledgeable guy and it certainly shows in his lectures... I enjoyed his class so much that I took the 4N03 seminar that he teaches.", "Quite an amazing professor. This social media class is the most useful one I have taken yet. Dr. Sevigny brings his own experience to the classroom. Also one of the best public speakers I have ever seen. I think he should be Prime Minister. Busy man - catch him in a free moment and he'll talk to you but can be hard to find him outside office hours.", "Intriguing man. Seems to be a lot to him, but seems to be strangely sad sometimes. Sevigny's lecture style is amazing and he has the best real-world examples. But I am always wondering... who is he&#63; A mystery. Fantastic professor, though - scary smart and cultured.", "Great speaker, engages class extremely well. Gives several assignments that only take a couple hours to complete and have small weightings which helps ease first year students into university expectations and allows for steady improvement over the semester. Very passionate communicator and wants the best for his students.", "Dr. Sevigny is an inspiring person. He makes you feel safe and secure when you are with him in class. When I talk to him after class, or in his office, I never see the time go by. He's a very good man. It's a shame few of us get to know him well. I'm jealous of his lab manager - she spends so much time with him and he obviously really likes her.", "Sometimes, you are lucky to run into a professor as talented and passionate Dr Sevigny. He cares a lot about his students' well-being and he focuses on students' development as individuals. He also does his best to promote students in their careers. Be careful though - he will ask you to be honest with yourself. That can be a hard thing to do.", "Extremely passionate and the most brilliant professor I had in 6 years! Extremely knowledgeable and his market experience differentiate him from other scholars. Fair marker; he probably can't stand stupidity. If you are a serious student and that you take learning seriously, i.e. actually read your textbooks, you'll love him.", "Bad communication skills, difficult to reach for help, goes on a useless tangents about self and therefore does not have time left for actual course material. He still test on topics he did not teach and is a hard marker. Low use of communication textbook which he co-authored and made us buy for the sake of royaltees.", "Alex is an excellent prof. Really knows political comm/elections. Wish I got to know him better. He's so busy and in-demand that it's hard to catch up to him. He doesn't suffer fools well either so if he seeks you out, that's a compliment - be thankful. His lab manager is a very lucky woman to be able to spend so much time with him. I'm jealous.", "Alex is a overall great guy. He knows his stuff and doesn't try to shove it down your throat. We would stop for coffee breaks (8:30 class) and he would come ask everyone how the weekend was. Classy professor that deserves his good reputation. He is still friends with the majority of this older students, always a positive sign.", "A truly decent person and a pleasure to have a professor. I learned more during this course than in any other of my undergrad. My favourite course of all the ones I took at McMaster. Period.", "Dr S\u00e9vigny is, quite simply, a true gentleman and superb professor. He is my model, now that I am in graduate school.", "Dr. S\u00e9vigny was one of the most approachable and helpful professors I've had at McMaster. He was always willing to set aside time to see me and answer any questions I had, and was very enthusiastic during class when teaching.", "I really enjoy the news analysis class. Alex is a mysterious guy - there's more to him than meets the eye. Both he and his subject matter fascinate me. A little intimidatingly smart though. Don't know what I would converse about with him - I would be shy.", "Alex is a very clear speaker and makes quantitative content analysis understandable. He's quite friendly too and very fashionable. It's a pleasure to come to class. I look forward to it every week.", "What an amazing man. I learned so much from Dr Sevigny - how to measure and analyze the news. It was only when I left Mac and met a PR agency owner friend for coffee on Yorkville that I realized how active he is as a strategic consultant. Such an unassuming, gentle man but amazingly influential. Everyone who's anyone seems to know him.", "The class was so useful. Professor Sevigny was very helpful. He made us reflect theoretically, but also emphasized public relations strategy and tactics. I am using EVERYTHING he taught us in my first job after graduation. Dr Sevigny's got style, too which is cool...", "Friendly and caring. We talked about McLuhan at the bus stop once. Great lecturer - lots of writing in the course though. Inspired me to major in comms.", "I found every lecture very interesting and entertaining. I couldn't help but listen.", "The class is pretty interesting, but it is also greatly impacted by your T.A as well. Mine didn't teach me or the rest of the class anything. So it made the assignments a bit of a challenge. But overall it's a fair course.", "Dr. Sevigny is an excellent professor. He explains the methodology very clearly and walks the class through the work in a confident and easy-going manner. I really learned how to do a content analysis in a professional fashion in this class. He also brought two PR professionals who discussed how content analysis fits into their work.", "I was in Ottawa and saw Alex across a room at a Halloween party full of media people and political insiders. I didn't think he'd remember me so I didn't say hello. He was there with a very beautiful girl. I was jealous. He was such a calming presence in class.", "I graduated in 2005 and have bumped into Alex in a bunch of professional occasions (luncheons,etc). You have to be killing yourself in the workworld, achieving things painfully to start admiring what Alex has achieved. Everybody who's anybody in Canada knows him-in the biz, in politics, in government, activism. Be his friend-his network is golden.", "Let me put this as simply as possible - I graduated from Mac three years ago. I recently ran into Alex at convention. He is, quite simply, a beautiful, beautiful man. You do not know what a treasure he is until you leave Mac. One in a million.", "Took 1A03 with this guy as an elective in first year engineering 4 years ago. Easiest course at McMaster (that I know of). Went to 3 lectures, a few tutorials, spent a grand total of 20 minutes skimming the readings, ****ted my report, and got an A. Highly recommended for filler value.", "I don't what people are complaining about - Alex is fascinating. It totally hooked me into CMST + he only used the f-word once to illustrate a point about using &quot;shock value&quot; in communication. It obviously worked, since people seem to remember that he did it. He set my internship up for me this summer - he didn't have to do that for me.", "I had him last year the class was huge but he is an excellent lecturer - he brought in a guest which I found pointless - also the blogging was a little pointless but simple - really enjoyed his class & did well - reading the text isn't too necessary just make sure you attend lectures - doesn't reply to emails quick but always available after class", "I am a graduate of the CMST program. If people don't like Alex, it's because they are jealous. He is brilliant, kind and nurturing. He has taken time to keep in touch with me since I graduated and helped me get my first job through one of his friends who runs a communications business in Toronto. Alex is a class act and a great friend.", "Worst Prof EVER! Totally over-rated and he is SOOO BOORING and tough. And I would never recommend anyone to take any of his courses.", "Alex is just amazing. He crackles with energy. When he enters a room, the room lights up. I was so in awe of him during class. He brought guest lecturers from the media biz as well as corporate comms. I actually got a job with one of them because I kept in touch after the guest lecture. I just love Alex - he has a wonderful, soothing voice too.", "It is cool having a professor who is always being interviewed on TV or in the newspaper. Also, he brought Gerard Kennedy in as a guest speaker - I was so impressed! Gerard and Alex took time to talk for hours afterward lecture and then I got a ride with them to a reception. It was AMAZING!!!", "I loved taking his class. He does begin speaking french randomly which gets annoying, but overall his class was super easy with the 1pg. assignments that you picked topics for and only 4 blogs. My TA was really great though. I honestly read hardly anything .. but went to all of the lectures and ended up with an A- .. I would take his classes again.", "HE is SOOOOOOOOOO TOUGHHHHHHH", "By far the worst professor I've come across so far at McMaster. Ignores your concerns expressed directly to him. I am simply ashamed that I spent money to be lectured by such a man.", "umm isnt he supposed to be a good communicator&#63; randomly swears in class and talks about random stuff. very boring still.", "In my 4 years at Mac, I have never been so disappointed with a professor as I have been in Dr. Sevigny. Disorganized, egocentric, unfocused lectures, poorly facilitated discussion and assignments, clear favourites and unprofessional conduct. Avoid his classes at all costs--it'll save you time, money and the frustration of being taught by him.", "Who are these negative reviewers&#63; Alex is the best professor at McMaster, bar none. I am in fourth year and have had many. He's a fantastic lecturer, intellectual heavyweight and incredible well connected. These children should realize the kind of person they are lucky to have teach them in first year!", "Dr. S\u00e9vigny is a pretentious, condescending prof. Sure, he brought 'industry experts' in, but when they're his politician buddies, days before election, you question his motives. Forget organization, his website reflected dates of years past and course outlines conflicted with other requirements. The text, never used, but coauthored by Dr. S\u00e9vingy.", "Alex is AMAZING. He brought guest speakers from Industry & Government & knowledge about pol comms, which is his specialty. Of course he talks about his experiences! Just chatting with him is an education. He is also extremely kind - he would stay for an hour after class to chat and encourage. He's single too - he would make a great, cool husband.", "I understand the positive comments but should not teach a 4th year course. 3 hour seminar, talked 90% of the time about himself and his accomplishments. Had a bunch of assignments, the topics of which he would conveniently teach after they were due. Openly criticized students. Favourtism is apparent. Could have been amazing, instead a huge letdown.", "I just sat there in class, listened and thought about how much he would be a great husband... smart, cool, successful. Ireally enjoyed this class... super organization and great material.", "This professor is magic. I had him in the summer class. He's so intriguing too... I have a huge crush on him.", "I agreed he was the best in 1A03, but he is also the worst in 4N03. Nothing was taught, keep rambling on something that aren't fit into the discussion. A Full 2 hours lecture on the discussion of duration of grad. studies & on President George. Eventually, our textbook has never been used, such a waste of money.", "Dr. Sevigny is a wicked lecturer. He brings comms to life. I looked forward to lecture every day. He had us mesmirized, even though he often lectured for 2 hours or 3 hours straight. He's easy on the eyes too. His eye sparkle when gets excited.", "These people are crazy. Dr. Sevigny is the best researcher in the department and we finally got a high level of discussion from his &quot;rambling on&quot;. What twits these people are. The class took advantage of the fact that he is a nice guy and tried to get him to dumb down the assignments. I enjoyed his discussions - he's brilliant and makes sense.", "Took over for a professor that fell ill about a month into class. Did a very poor job, did not explain assignments well at all, did not lecture, made the class very boring. Rambled on and on about things unrelated to class topic and we did not have one single mark until the last day of class. I think we should all get our money back.", "Dr Sevigny is amazing. I am a fourth year Poli Sci student and am wishing that I could now switch into Communications. He gives very high level commentary and is great value during lecture and during office hours. THe first-year students don't know how lucky they are to have a Prof. of this quality who likes teaching them.", "very good prof ! very down to earth and helpful", "What are these people talking about&#63; Dr Sevigny brings a ton of personal experience into the classroom! What do they prefer someone who doesn't enrich course content&#63; His examples are amazing. He found me an internship with the Liberal Party. By the way, he has no political aspirations - he is a communications consultant, not a politician.", "very good teacher, but he says &quot;right&quot; and &quot;you know&quot; after every sentence. tends to get annoying. Also talks very fast. otherwise, his explanations are very clear, the examples he uses are VERY helpful.", "how can people like this professor&#63; he's terrible!  he talks about his dreams of being a politician, goes over class time, and then gets frustrated when people start to shuffle their belongings to go to their next classes.  his lecture speed is way too fast, in my opinion.  there's no other professor for cmst, so i guess you're stuck with him. :(", "He is an incredibly hard marker, is of no help when needed as i emailed him several times and had no response, isn't direct with what he wants out of his papers...rarely bell curves....", "He's great. So smart and funny. He's cute too... I always find a question to ask him after lecture. :)", "He is an amazing professor who makes the course interesting.

Nice to talk to. Will take time for you if you go to his office and search him out. Although his intelligence is sometimes a little intimidating, he is very gentle in face to face contact.

She's the only first year prof I've had who learnt my name. Definitely this course requires work, but it's so fun it doesn't even feel like work. I looked forward to this class", "best prof in the world. not only is she sarcastic and hilarious and the strongest baddest b ever she's so caring and helpful. knows her whole class' names!! i failed a quiz and went to see her and she sat with me as we went over it and ended up changing my mark to 80", "The BEST prof I've ever had. Honestly, although her class was difficult and the final was hell for many she really makes you work hard and love physics. Thanks to her I'm going into physics as her lectures were so interesting and different from other classes.", "One of the  best profs I have had. She is sassy and super fun to be around. She really cares about her students but YOU have to take the initiative to be a good student. The marks will not be handed on a silver plate but they will be most definitely well deserved. She is nothing if not fair. Worth taking this class as a challenge.", "She's super funny and she's so chill with the students!", "Very tough tests. No notes were ever posted and lots of homework assignments. Didn't like her teaching style at first but got used to it and enjoyed it on the end. Pushes understanding not memorizing.", "Amazing prof that really shows how awesome physics is. Upon coming to university I hated physics, but after having Dr. Hughes as a prof for two first year physics courses (only took the second because I knew Hughes was teaching it), I'm probably going to end up going into physics now.", "No lecture or overhead slides at all. She expects you to read the textbook before class and does quizzes on the material before she teaches it. She also tends to randomly pick people in the class and asks them questions which is intimidating. Do not take this course with her!", "I don't know where the hate is coming from but definitely THE best prof for physics first year. So many people from other profs ended up sitting in on her lectures. Ask around! I'm not lying. And she is such a sweet person. Really cares to see you understanding the material. Will even know your name by the end of class!", "I love her teaching style, she's funny and interesting. She always keeps me awake by making me constantly take notes.. Unlike some of my courses where the profs just read from the lecture slides.", "most terrible professor if you are new to the apparently \"univeristy\" method of teaching that involves \"no notes, no powerpoints, no overheads\"", "Dr. Hughes is an absolutely incredible physics prof. Her lectures are clear, engaging, and insightful, and she is always open to helping students and answering questions. Her style, no doubt, is not for everyone, but if you are seeking an intellectually gratifying physics experience I would highly recommend taking a class with Dr. Hughes.", "She's way too quirky. No lecture notes provided at all. No powerpoints, only overheads which she never copies for us. 53 average on first midterm.", "Karen Hughes is really good at physics and teaches it well. However, she gives homework almost every class as if this is the only course we have for the term.", "She is a nice lady, but I hate her lecture style. Basically, you teach yourself through the textbook and ask questions during the lecture time. If you are not good at physics, I would suggest another prof. The midterm was ridiculous, 50% average, and she's surprised we did so bad.", "Good prof, tests are fun and challenging, but gives too many boring assignments.", "Absolutely hated physics after the first class I took, but Hughes was a huge improvement. She made the class interesting with all the demonstrations and such, and was great at explaining things. I do wish she would post notes online, and the tests were EXTREMELY hard.", "I absolutely loved Dr Hughes! At first, I was quite disgruntled by her lack of note making, but she is be far the best prof I've had so far. She really makes you understand what you're doing, instead of just giving you equations and telling you to use them. If you ask her for help, she will make sure you understand the main concepts and is thorough", "Dr. Hughes is an EXCELLENT prof, I had her for both Physics 1B03 and 1BA3. She is quirky, yet clear and VERY interesting. Don't come to class asleep though because there is some serious thinking required. Her midterms and exams are also BRUTAL, but she is very eager to help if you go see her.", "Difficult tests, but SO much fun. Physics isn't really my forte and I was initially upset that she doesn't post notes on avenue, but I found that you don't really need them in the sense that she really makes the lectures worthwhile. Class was almost always filled with discussions, and she (somehow) made physics really fun to learn about!", "I had Dr. Hughes for 1B03 and 1BA3 last year. Her teaching style did not revolve around equations but rather on concepts. She did a great job keeping the class engaged, and lectures will full of discussions. I did not sit through one lecture without thinking extensively about a problem. She is very clear in all of her explanations. Excellent prof", "She is honestly the best prof i have had to date and i am a biopsych Major. But don't confuse her amazing teaching style with the level of difficulty. She is awesome but if physics is not your cup of tea the class prolly wont be the highlight of your day", "I had Dr. Hughes for 1B03 and 1BA3. She was a great prof, well I thought. A lot of people hated it cause they didnt like the difficulty of Physics. She was always so helpful, whenever I had a question or concern I would just ask and she would help. I got a C+ in 1B03 and a B- in 1BA3. The courses were tough but, she made it fun to learn", "Our class got KILLED on her midterms but she is a super nice and funny prof who explains things so well that I felt stupid for not understanding stuff after she went over it...she makes it look so easy!", "If you are looking for a traditional physics teacher that just puts formulas on the board and gives you problems, you will not find this here. She is always interactive with her class and is always keeping you thinking. People may complain about her not giving out class notes, but you don't need them! She makes everything easy to understand and FUN", "Professor Hughes had her own unique way of teaching, which I don't think is for everyone. She did not provide notes, but instead taught a lesson almost in a story format. You really have to pay attention in her class and take really good notes. She keeps you engaged and is very approachable after class. I personally enjoyed her teaching style.", "She's not for everyone and she admits that. I didn't like her just because she didn't give solid notes, admittedly i skipped classes though. She's approachable, usually answers any q's after class", "If you are hesitant about taking physics, DO NOT take it with this prof", "Honestly the best professor I have ever had. Rather than giving a list of equations and boring notes she uses the lecture time to explain the concepts to us. Generally, a class will consist of a quiz or two, her telling us why we're wrong, us arguing, and then her proving us wrong again. This helps us learn alot. 10 out of 10!", "Knows her stuff very well! Always answers class questions and actually makes an effort to learn people's names! The class is not easy, but Dr. Hughes makes physics *gasp* fun!", "Well the last person probably failed physics....   still hughes is a great teacher, she is completely willing to stay after class for however long to help you, and she explains everything crystal clear, plus she makes physics more fun that it probably should be.", "A terrible professor. Doesn't know how to teach, and has bad attitude toward students.", "Still the person from the last comment. It's absolutely untrue to say that she does not help, or belittles you. No. On the other hand she will always provide help, and she understands what you have problem with and knows the exact words you need to hear to understand. Her classes are engaging and interesting. Serious phy people always liked her.", "She was the best prof I've had in 1st yr 1st sem. Wonderful teaching style. Some would prefer the stupid &quot;slides&quot; or &quot;formal notes&quot;. But physics is not organization, structure, information. It's about understanding and applying in the problem, and she makes them crystal clear. You won't get anywhere with the &quot;slides&quot; and &quot;organized&quot; presentations.", "Just like other people say, she is very enthusiastic and makes physics seem like fun. However, physics is a very tricky subject and needs a lot of time and effort, I guess formal course notes could have been used. Don't know if that would have changed difficulty though.", "The rating for this professor will vary drastically from person to person. Her teaching style's different. There are no 'formal' notes. You have to make the conscious effort to study on your own and discuss those concepts in class. If you don't like her way of running the course, then you will HATE her. If it suits you, you will love her class.", "Just when you think you understand physics, well a thing or two always goes wrong. Her lectures are really interesting and not to mention her &quot;physics jokes&quot; really make the class more enjoyable.", "Not a bad prof, I liked how she explained things although I was annoyed at how she randomly picked people to answer. The in-classes quizzes were good for showing how much material we should know, and she was so funny... &quot;What is the floor made of&#63;&quot; *silence* &quot;Floor atoms!!&quot;", "A little intimidating to approach, and can belittle you somewhat. I think she does care however, because she makes an effort to be clear and thorough with her explanations.", "Average Prof", "No Comments", "She teaching concepts well in class, but she does like to pick on people, and many don't like that. She is also very hard to approach, and can make you feel very stupid when you ask a question. She teaches well, but she stops students from asking for more assistance.", "Her teaching techniques are definately different. Class notes were useless, and picking on random people was pretty nerve racking too. Hated it.", "Very clear! She would explain things so well, you would understand and then ask you a question that really makes you wonder if you do in fact understand. When she solves the problem the world makes sense again", "her teaching style is based on self-learning. she will make u do questions and then give u the answer. Randomly picking ppl was kinda annoying (but thank God) she never picked on me. yeah, did someone mention that she doesnt wear a bra.. which is more annoying than randomly picking ppl. u cant concentrate in calss bc of that!", "Worst prof ever.", "if you don't like being randomly picked on in class, I suggest you do not have her as a prof", "sooooo hard. wont help you out at all. worst class everrr. if u dont absoluteelyy loveeee physics then dont take it with her.", "She often assigns a problem, goes on a coffee break during lecture for 10min, and finds that she has to solve the question herself wasting more time.  Lecture notes were garbage, and yes the random picking of people in class was very annoying.", "Shes a Great prof (10/10)  She helped me a lot!!! Go to her office if you need help and shell help you a lot!  You have to stay awake in her lectures too cause she does throw randome things out (which are good!)", "Even though I failed the class, I have to say Hughes is a very good prof. Very engaging, and you always have to pay attention in case she randomly picks you to answer a question.", "No Comments", "the hardest and most traumatizing course i had to go through...it was actually worse than calculus! she used to pick random ppl, which was so embarrassing, especially if u didn't know the answers. and omg! her style of lecturing was just rediculous :(!!!", "great prof, very patient, doesn't have set office hours which is a pain, she randomly chooses people to participate in class, doesn't have notes-gotta make your own. 50% of class will fail the exam.", "No Comments", "No Comments", "OMG..the best thing ever was the gun, the gorilla and the hat :D I heart hughes!", "No Comments", "No Comments", "Great Prof! Engaging and helpful. If I had any doubts about ever taking more physics courses during university, she abolished them!", "Good prof...Hard tests if you don't like physics + she needs to learn that there is a thing called a bell curve! Apparently she doesn't know about it...", "Physics is annoying yet she somehow made the class interesting.  Quite impressive indeed...", "amazing prof", "No Comments"], "credit": ["Yes", "Yes", "Yes", "Yes", "Yes", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A"]}, "Konstantin Kreyman": {"would_take_again": ["N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A"], "textbook": ["N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A"], "difficulty": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 3.0, 1.0, 1.0, 3.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 1.0, 1.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0, 5.0, 3.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 3.0, 2.0, 4.0, 3.0, 1.0, 1.0, 4.0, 3.0, 1.0, 3.0, 4.0, 3.0, 5.0, 3.0, 5.0, 3.0], "date": ["12/18/2005", "08/12/2005", "11/29/2004", "07/01/2004", "05/27/2004", "05/18/2004", "04/01/2004", "03/23/2004", "02/29/2004", "02/10/2004", "02/02/2004", "12/15/2003", "12/14/2003", "12/13/2003", "12/10/2003", "12/08/2003", "12/07/2003", "12/01/2003", "04/12/2003", "04/11/2003", "04/11/2003", "04/10/2003", "03/27/2003", "03/10/2003", "02/28/2003", "02/23/2003", "02/17/2003", "02/11/2003", "02/07/2003", "12/18/2002", "12/11/2002", "12/05/2002", "11/26/2002", "10/14/2002", "06/07/2002", "04/15/2002", "04/14/2002", "04/12/2002", "04/10/2002", "04/03/2002", "03/29/2002", "03/25/2002", "03/21/2002", "02/20/2002", "02/12/2002", "02/08/2002", "02/04/2002"], "quality": [4.0, 1.0, 2.5, 4.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 3.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 4.5, 3.0, 4.0, 2.5, 5.0, 5.0, 2.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 3.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 4.0, 3.0, 1.5, 2.5, 2.5, 4.0, 1.0, 1.0, 3.5, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 1.5, 3.0, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 1.0, 2.0], "id": 24775, "attendance": ["N/A", "N/A", "Mandatory", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "Mandatory", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A"], "grammar": [0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "name": ["ENG1P03", "ENG1P03", "ENG1P03", "ENG1D04", "ENG1P03", "ENGP03", "ENG1P03", "ENG1P03", "1P3", "1P03", "ENG1P03", "ENG1D04", "ENG1P03", "ENG1P03", "ENG1P03", "1PO3", "1P03", "1P03", "1D04", "ENG1D04", "1D04", "1D04", "1D04", "ENG1DO4", "ENG", "ENG1D04", "ENG1D04", "ENG1D04", "1D04", "1D04", "ENG1D04", "1D04", "1D04", "ENG101", "ENG1D04", "1D04", "ENG1D4", "ENG1D04", "ENG1D4", "ENG1D3", "1D04", "ENG1D04", "1D4", "1D04", "1D04", "1D04", "ENG1D04"], "sentiment": [0.7875, 0.0, 0.10277777777777776, 0.6, 0.11166666666666662, 1.0, 0.316, 0.0, 0.5, 0.1375, 0.06666666666666665, 0.04305555555555555, -0.14027777777777778, 0.4666666666666666, -0.3, 0.8, 0.09531249999999997, -0.030555555555555558, 0.225, -0.3791666666666667, -0.19487179487179485, 0.625, 0.44999999999999996, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.18749999999999997, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.6, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.011458333333333182, 0.0, -0.4625, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.0, 0.16666666666666666], "comments": ["Genuinely good guy and good prof.

I went because his teaching style was so good, it was engaging and logical. He answers student's questions well and clearly.", "Great lecturer keeps you interested and sometimes sings", "Excellent prof. Even though he posts all his lectures online, his classes are always full. That should speak to how well of a job he is doing.", "I would recommend Prof. McLean over and over again. His teaching ability is outstanding especially if you have trouble in calculus. He is always available for help and questions. His wit and hilarity make lectures not only fun but something to look forward to.", "wastes alot of time cracking jokes, but I dont mind it that way. The less material he covers, the less ill have to study", "hes a good prof, available after class for help. teaches well and makes the material really understandable. Also makes lectures \"fun\" and entertaining. For some reason, i still didn't do TOO well in the course, maybe cause it stats lol but overall he's an awesome prof.", "Dr. McLean is the best and there's nothing new about that. The entire uni and math department already know that by now. Dr. Mclean makes 8:30 classes so interesting that it's worth going to. Moreover, his lecture notes are heavenly. Easily the best math prof the uni has ever had.", "This guy will teach you math that you will remember in your 50s.", "This guy will teach you math that you will remember in your 50s. Amazing professor, will take him again!", "McLean is a great professor, I took him in my Engineering first year for Math 1ZA3. He is the best professor I have ever know. He teaches so well and maintains a friendly atmosphere in class. He has a lot of funny jokes. Due to his teaching I changed my complete Winter schedule so that I can get McLean in Winter too.", "He's hilarious and great in lectures. Explains things thoroughly and sets fair exams. Just do all the homework and it's not bad. MSAF the second test, trust me lol", "Mr. Mclean was a very entertaining and sometimes slightly cringy proffessor", "Favorite teacher in my first year. I had him in MATH 1ZB3 and MATH 1ZC3, he really helped me a lot. As long as attending his class and put a bit effort, an A is totally doable. Even though his classes are on the morning, I strongly suggest you guys to attend. Teaches very clearly and is very funny and easy to talk with. 6 out of 5 on the rating!", "McLean is the best. He explains clearly and chips in jokes every now and then. The only bad thing about his class is that everyone wants to be in it so it's usually very full. Get to class early. Trust me  it's worth the 8:30", "Easily my greatest prof in first year engineering", "Best prof I met so far. The classroom is always full even when it is close to the end of the term", "Definitely an amazing prof, I am so glad to have all the math lectures he teaches in first year.", "He's cool and really makes an effort to make the class interesting. His jokes can be out of the line at times and a little awkward, but is very open to questions during lecture.", "Awesome lectures. Very thorough in explaining concepts, pays close attention to detail, passionate, never a dull moment. Wish I had him for future courses.", "He loves math sooo much!!! Best teacher for this class!!", "He is SO funny and has SO much enthusiasm!! I had him for a summer course, so lectures were SO long and our room wasn't air conditioned, and he STILL got everyone to come! He explains everything really well. He is also the most helpful one if the math help center. Switch cores to have any math class with him if you have the option!!", "Chris is a great prof. Love the enthusiasm! Very inspirational!", "He's Very Engaging and uses plenty of visual and cognitive examples and models to get the course ideas across. Tests are not easy, but usually stuff you've seen before.   I failed the first time I took the course (1ZB3) but I took it again and got an A so if you pay attention and keep up, you should be fine, the material isn't overly challenging", "Amazing Prof!!", "Sole reason I passed first year calculus.", "awesome proff", "Such a good professor!!", "Really interesting lectures. He somehow manages to make over 300 students interested in calculus at 8:30 in the morning. ", "Extremely clear. One of the best professors in McMaster by far!", "Easily the best prof i've had", "I didn't think I would ever say that calculus was my favourite class to go to until I had this guy as a prof.  Great guy, fantastic prof.", "This man is a god. If you have not had the pleasure of sitting in one of his lectures, you need to do so ASAP. Even though I'm not in his second semester math class, I will definitely be going to it regardless of what my timetable says. He is loud, hilarious and actually teaches you what you need to know in an entertaining way. Absolute legend.", "Great Teacher. He makes class much easier with clear explanations. Does not complicate things. The things he writes on the overhead are excellent notes. He was able to make people laugh at 830 am . At the end of the last lecture everyone stood up and gave him a standing ovation. absolute legend.", "Best prof for first year eng you can have. Even when I wasn't in his class, I would rearrange my schedule to make to to go to it. I've had 4 math profs at Mac, and this guy is far and away the best.", "Probably the best prof I've had. He does a really great job at keeping lectures entertaining and informative. A difficult task-- especially with a course like stats. I wish he taught all my courses, honestly.", "One of the most awesome profs you could have as a first year engineering student. Entertaining lectures, usually overcrowded with people from other sections. Very helpful. Tests and exams typically follow sample test format.", "Amazing clarity, effectiveness, and enthusiasm. Great character!", "He is so nice and helpful, truly has such a passion for teaching. I SUCK at math and he spent almost 15 minutes with me explaining special triangles and pie. He genuwinely cared that i didn't understand the concept and spent time with me to help me understand. I dont think anyone has his level of patience at the the math help centre! Thanks!", "Great professor, knows his audience really well and is more than willing to assist any student struggling, you just have to ask for help! Tests are fair and assignments are easy if you go to class and pay attention. Highly recommend him as a 1st year math professor especially.", "Great teacher! Really funny and all you have to do is ask if you don't understand. Tests we're fair and so were the assignments. Super easy to talk to and will even go out of his way to talk to you if he knows you!", "Made tests incredibly more difficult than the work done in class. Kept lectures too simple and didn't help me at all. Had to teach myself Stats at the end of the day and my mark suffered because of it.", "Many of his in-class examples failed, so they became very unhelpful. I wish he was more organized. Exam was rather hard compared to rest of material.", "I love this guy...hes so helpful and willing to answer any questions math related.  His tests are fine and not that difficult if you understand the material.  Just work hard in his class and you will surely succeed.  He's the BEST!!!", "Really great prof. Only time i did well in math.", "BEST prof of 1st Year Engineering, imo. Hilarious, helpful, and humble. Very understandable, lectures are interesting and engaging. HIGHLY recommended, switch course cores until you get one with this guy!", "Great prof", "No Comment", "Favorite teacher. And this feeling only grew stronger the other day when he mentioned the big bang theory in his lecture :)", "Very entertaining professor, and made the easy boring calculus more enjoyable. His midterms and exam were quite easy, despite a low class grade. He spends extensive amounts of time explaining simple concepts, but should have been very helpful for those not understanding the content. Practice problems given in class or website were similar to tests.", "Very entertaining professor, and made the easy boring calculus more enjoyable.

He never made me feel stupid either, plus our TA that he set up review sessions with was amazing!", "I can't figure out why Dr. McLean has a low overall rating! He is awesome. Lectures are easy, he's excellent at explaining things, gives great practice problems, very fair tests and is great with the assignments. I was worried about uni calc because I hadn't had it since the beginning of grade 12 but he made the transition seamless. One of the best", "Fantastic. Very funny in a super cheesy way but it keeps things interesting. Very clear and consist, I would never have gotten through calculus without him. Passionate about math, and loves to make fun of himself - it's great.", "Very humorous, which keeps math class interesting.", "Funniest dude ever!!", "ONE OF THE BEST MATH TEACHERS I'VE HAD. Because he taught me calculus, it's not as scary and hard as I expected.. i might even dare say it's quite easier than advanced functions! love love love him. Full of positive energy, consistent mood, funny mentions of his lizard Hector, same different coloured hats and same different coloured shirts!", "A brilliant man that is incredibly passionate about his subject. I really don't think it's fair that people condemn him for writing &quot;hard&quot; tests. This is university, where we are supposed to be challenged. Easy tests leave students unchallenged and with a superficial understanding of the material. This isn't highschool. You have to WORK to do well.", "Hilarious, animated, and at the same time clear with his explanations and analogies. I haven't had a test in his class yet but he seems more than willing to help people out as best he can both in class and during office hours.", "He's an amazing professor! He tries his best to help everyone that requires it and always answers all his e-mails, even with fully explained solutions! He's dedicated, very very passionate about what he teaches and loves to crack jokes to make us grin. He tries his best to make his students learn as much as they can while still being extremely fair", "His doors are always open for &quot;math help&quot; but he closes the doors to your future when he gives you a failing grade in his courses. His exams are the most unfair, tricky+ ambigous. Why is this Joker teaching engineering students&#63; He doesn't understand we have other hard courses already. He increases our stress level with his ridiculously hard tests.", "This prof does not even remember the combination of his own locks at the math help centre. Then how can he be suited to teach University level math&#63; A lot of students witnessed the scene he created when he could not open the cabinet because he forgot his lock's combination. Wasted so much time of students that day. Gives poor grades to students.", "Amazing Prof. VERY Helpful prof. He is the Number 1 prof in my books, that's why I'm giving him top ratings all ONE's. He is so easy on the eyes too. I go to class, just to stare at him. My summer is going so well this time, just because this prof is eye candy. I would love to make out with him ;)", "he takes teaching very seriously and thinks he's all that, and what not, he thinks he's such a great prof. but he does not take the grades he assigns to students very seriously. giving low grades and UNFAIR TESTS makes him feel happy. what a sad excuse of a C.L.A instructor. Hope mcmaster doesn't re-hire him.", "XD at all these comments", "I saw this Big Boy shopping one day, he had so much food in his cart. I guess he loves to eat. He writes very unreasonable exams and the failure of his students gives him happiness. Mean sadistic proffff", "Great prof, great gut", "He makes his midterms very challenging. HE seems like a nice guy but he really needs to learn that a test is a test NOT A CHALLENGE.", "I want to go on a date with this prof but I am too shy to ask him out. Hopefully he will be my Valentine. That would be a dream come true.", "Amazing Prof. Dr. McLean is AmAzInG. He really knows first year calculus. He must be a very smart guy. I mean, think about it, HE KNOWS FIRST YEAR CALCULUS which is the hardest thing in the whole Universe. He teaches people how to take the derivative, how to take the integral. Those big big words like derivative, integral make me very VERY scared.", "He's cute! :)", "awesome prof! very funny!", "nice beard! and his cap is nice too.", "Fun and slightly crazy. Good teacher too, though gets sidetracked at times.", "Lots of energy and great examples. He makes for a fun class!", "he iz a kewl dude....awesome teacher", "Makes good (and constant) use of cheesy pop culture analogies to math.", "Great prof. Explained PDEs very well. The silly math dept only gave him one course in the fall. Fools!", "Oh Chris McLean, where would we be without you&#63;  Uses great examples, often involving some sort of horrible death, such as a molasses silo breaking down and covering a whole town in sticky goo.  His pacman analogy made me understand f(g(x))!  Great guy.", "Spends way too much time doing useless derivations, and he makes each of three multiple choice questions on a test worth 15% of the test mark with no part marks.  Could be doing better in the course with a better prof", "Best Math prof out there.. actually.. best prof all together! HALARIOUS TOO! He even beats childs! Very funny.. I've never missed a class.. and i actually understand calculus! He's the best there is!                                               ps. If at first you don't succeed, re-define success! LOL!", "jokes guy...knows his****....great prof", "Amazing prof.\r Knows the material, explains really well, and is just a cool guy.

PPL thought he's mean and tight on the markings but actually he's very helpful if you go talk to him.  He spent 40 minutes going through my midterm with me and gave me useful tips on the finals.

"comments": ["Truly skilled professor! I wish she taught all my classes! Expert information, personable, clear expectations. All the negative comments came from students who thought uni would be easy..Not so.always available for questions and easy to relate to. Thanks Dr V!", "Possibly opposed to the use of fertilizers to treat clinically depressed foliage herba.  Seemingly opposed to the use of soap to wash cars, but undoubtedly a capable professor.", "Dr. Vaillancourt is quiet beautiful. I think her husband is so lucky :)", "She is not the best prof I've had.  Though she was entertaining and seemingly an easy going prof, she was actually very difficult and borderline unpleasant because of her attitude towards the class.  Her tests were tough to say the least.  Her personal experience in psych makes her an interesting prof but it's not quite enough to redeem her I think", "Useless worthless experience. Donot recommend her to anyone ever. Her final was brutal. She doesn't like the class average to be more then 70", "Tests were hard but OK still. Final exam was brutal.", "She was clearly the worst professor ever. She told us once that if the class average was very high she would lose her job. I guess she already has even after the class average being low. She often made false promises and her finals were always very hard.", "mean, arrogant, selfish prof. Never keeps her promises. Overall sad combination", "Worst professor ever.  If you can't see through her fake skin, then university hasn't taught you to be critical enough.  She is deceptive, selfish, narcissistic, and could care less about the success of her students. She does, however, give a great example of what a FAKE person is like - right to the dot.", "Very Funny Prof. Made 8:30 class worth going to. Past comments are blown way out of proportion because if you went to class you would do well as she gives hints to her questions. One of the most interesting classes I have taken here. Loved her and sad she is gone.", "She makes Lame Jokes and is SOO TOUGH!!!", "She used to be nice many years ago but not anymore!!!! One of the toughest profs around now. Avoid her otherwise you will regret it.", "VERY Impersonable. She replies to emails like this &quot;Hi,&quot;, I have a name alright....what is &quot;Hi,&quot; &#63;&#63; She is soooo tough...she hates the class average to be more than 70-71%....she will kill the whole class on future tests and exam if the class average is high. Terrible attitude towards students. It's only a garbage PSYCH course!!! get a life!!", "Great prof!! She was helpful, understanding, clear, and the tests were very well organized. Learned alot!", "VERY HARD SHORT ANSWER QUESTIONS ON THE FINAL EXAM TAKE IT EASY ON MCMASTER STUDENTS PLEASE. STOP ASKING SHORT ANSWER QUESTIONS IF POSSIBLE. THANK YOU.", "I took both 3CC3 and 3N03 with Dr. V.  I received an 11 in both.  You can get an A in her class and I don't think she is any different from other profs when it comes to grades.  She is just up front about what is going on at the university.  Loved her classes.  Take them if you can!", "What a great prof, and a really interesting class. She cares about the material and is a very engaging speaker.", "She is a nice lady but her tests are kind of tough. Still her multiple choice are way easier than Dr.Day's multiple choice so quit complaining!!! Just read the book multiple times. Dont know how bad her short answers will be since didn't have the final yet. She always answers emails and is helpful if you talk to her after class.", "I totally agree with some of the comments people have posted --- She does not like the class average to be more than 70-73. Last year I took Forensic Psych with her and the average on both midterms was high (76-80) so she gave a deadly final with very specific multiple choice and brutal short answers. Not every psych prof has her type of mentality.", "Dr. Vaillancourt is a very good prof.  Profs are told by the university what the class averages should be.  If a prof's class averages are consistently too high, their employment is terminated.  So she should get fired so that you get the A+ you don't deserve&#63;", "She was very easy few years back. She NEVER ASKED short answer questions on any of the exams and her exams were entirely multiple choice few years back. Her exams were NEVER CUMULATIVE, they only covered second half of the course. Now she has changed and become tough as hell!!!", "Don't know where to start...this prof REALLY REALLY SUCKS. She has a bad attitude. When the class average is high she says things like &quot;Good Job&quot;, but she gets PISSSED from inside...she hates the class average to be more than 70. If the class scored high on one test, just watch you, she will throttle all of you in the 2nd test. Bad attitude!!", "She is an amazing lecturer. Stories are highly entertaining not to mention she has more jokes than chris rock and larry david combined. She knows the material very well and cares alot about her students. Overall one of the best classes ever. The tests are tough but fair.", "This prof is really tough. AVOID HER.....Her SHORT answer questions are nasty.", "great class.. interesting lectures and a great prof.  Her class was one of the best psych classes at Mac and shes one of the best profs! New stories and great energy every day.", "Very nice, makes learning fun....always has helpful hands-on learning examples due to experience. Would take any class she was teaching.", "Very unresponsive to students", "Nearly an entire lecture of her outfit not matching is not what I call higher education. She cared so much about us liking her that she forgot to teach - her narcissism went too far!", "She was someone that was very dynamic at first and then by the end of the term you realize that her door is not always open and she had given you a lot of false promises.", "excellent course. so interesting. the prof has alot of clinical strories that she shares. i recommend this course highly.", "Love her.  She is tough but seems to really care about her students.  Be sure to read the textbook several times before the exam.", "Her so-called 'SHORT answer' questions on exams are so disgusting EWWWWWW. This prof is way too serious. She jokes around in class, tells funny stories but don't let that fool you. She's tough as nails. She's very impersonable when answering emails. When you write Hi Dr.Vaillancourt, she replies like this &quot;Hi,&quot; (&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;) What is Hi,&#63;I have a name!!", "I highly recommend Abnormal.  Great lectures, fun professor although she is pretty tough!", "This prof is really hard I dont recommend anyone to take her section, she likes the class average to be around 70. She gets pissed if the class average is high. She says they'd kick me out if the clas average was 80's. This shows she got a bad attitude towards teaching and students! It's only PSYCH, Psych is NOTTTT a Science. It is an Arts program.", "Great prof, take abnormal psych with her and no other prof. Her exams are straightforward if you read the chapter multiple times, she explains very good and is funnny. But READ THE TEXTBOOK carefully and study all the lecture notes. No problems then.", "Loved Dr. V and loved the course!", "Excellent prof.  Take this class.", "Really fun class.  I highly recommend it.  Dr. V. makes the class interesting by linking the material to clinical cases.", "Best prof ever!", "Great speaker! I really enjoyed her lectures and she brought in some amazing guest speakers. Very helpful to her many students. I highly recommend this course.", "Excellent course.  NOT at all cndescending but is actually really nice and seems to care a lot about her students.  Not sure what the idiot below is talking about (BTW the prof is a she NOT he).", "incredibly patronizing and condescending... wouldn't take a class of hers again just because of that, despite the fact that when focusing on lectures, he makes a good prof.", "Good prof. She gets 5/5 for clarity, that's for sure.", "Good teaching ability, but not very helpful to students", "Great prof. the test was tufff though, but still the class average is high. study hard for her tests!!", "Good teaching ability, but very poor response to helping students and to emails.", "She cant teach.  Tries to get brownie points by telling us which celebrity broke up with whom.  Not needed, Dr. V.  Get back to what we need to know.", "I don't think her sense of humour is funny :(", "No Comments", "I would rather be impressed by what a prof can teach me instead of their knowledge of celebrity news. I dont think providing horror story examples are an effective way to teach students about sexual disorders. I did not find Dr. V to be very intelligent or articulate.", "No Comments", "She was extrememly helpful and knew how to dress well!!", "She's an amazing prof...makes the lectures really interesting...but if you think this is going to be a bird course, you're in for a surprise...it's not easy simply because there is so much material (this is advice from someone who got an A in the class, believe me). Anyway, one of the best profs at Mac by far.", "One of the best prof's at mac.  The only thing is her tests are quite tricky. As long as you know the text book inside out, and her notes, the tests are fine, but she tends to ask a lot of detail questions from the text.  Overall she is a super nice prof, and very enthusiastic.", "Best abnormal psych prof ever! A+++++! As long as you do the readings weekly, and enjoy learning Abnormal Psych, you're pretty much guaranteed a 10", "She's the most helpful and nicest prof. Prompty answers emails and tests aren't that difficult. Her course evaluations are higher than any of the other profs in the Department of Psychology, Neuroscience, and Behaviour. Just check under &quot;Course Evaluations&quot; on MUGSI. You will see her teaching performance is superior to all other faculty members.", "No Comments", "No Comments", "I hate most of my profs, but I don't hate her at all. That tells you something about how awesome she is! She is always fair, never out to get students, and is super nice and personable once you get to know her. Dr. Vaillancourt is the only fair (or perhaps, the MOST fair) prof in the psychology department. Wish she taught every course.", "No Comments", "Awesome prof!!!", "One of the greatest profs at Mac. Nice and easy going. She made Abnormal Child Psychology in summer school a fun and enjoyable class. The course was seminar style, but I liked it. Just read every chapter atleast 3 times and you'll get a good mark in her class. I strongly recommend everyone to take any class taught by her", "No Comments", "Interesting material. Intersting lectures and stories but yet test do not reflect anything taught. Would be an fun class to come to on your own time but not if u r looking to do well", "She is an excellent lecturer, and obviously intelligent, however needs to stick to lecture material and not her experience since that's what she tests on.  terrible attitude towards students outside of class.  too many cases of lost term papers and that's unacceptable.", "Very good teacher, great at explaining concepts and getting individuals interested in abnormal psychology. Essay was fair.  Test were terrible.  Too much reliance on memorizing relatively insignificant details and not enough testing on concepts. Test were poor indicators of understanding.", "The material was very interesting and the prof has quite a lot of knowledge on the topic, with good stories.  However, tests do not cover that material.  Was also not present for the exam to answer questions...which would have been helpful for many questions which were confusing.", "Her lectures were really great, and definitely made class interesting enough not to sleep through, however they got off topic WAY too easily, and her exams were not really fair...if you expect me to memorize the textbook teach more from it and not personal experience, and students papers were lost!!", "For whatever reason she didn't even attend the exam to answer questions that badly needed to be clarifed as a result of a multiple choice exam that appeared as though it had never been reviewed for errors.  Kind of disappointing.  I lost a lot of respect for her. Even some questions of moral nature.", "Interesting class, interesting material, lecturing is a bit scattered and she is not easy to follow when taking notes. She seems nicer in lecture than she really is when you meet her outside of class, and no I am not narcissistic!", "Very Enthusiastic and funny, but that\u00b4s often her problem. She gets off track and just tells you about her private stories. A bit more facts, like Dr. Roberts gave in his guest lecture would be good. Papers were delayed, admission should be limited.", "She's the BEST!!!", "My fav prof by far", "Dr. V really makes her lectures interesting.  I really enjoy the real life examples.  This class is great!", "One of the only profs that looks as good up close as she does from the back of the lecture hall :)  I love her stories, they really make the material relevant to real life...incredibly smart, looks at things from lots of different perspectives.  Great prof.", "Dr. Vaillancourt makes her 2 1/2 hour evening lecture enjoyable to attend.  Sometimes things get a little off-track, but that's part of what makes the class interesting.", "What an awesome prof. It's inspiring when a prof is passionate about what they do and actually care about their students. Going to night classes always seemed like punishment to me but I actually look forward to going to this one. She seems like a wonderful person (inside and out).", "I think Dr. Vaillancourt is one of THE best proffessors at Mac.. she is such a good teacher.. i enjoy her class.. and she makes the material seem soo interesting...her jokes are great! i commute for three hours to get to her class and i would hate to miss a single class... she makes all the effort a", "she is a fantastic prof, class is very interesting and eay to undrestand, she is very easy to follow and very interested in her work. Her tests and essays arent easy, she is very fair but dont take the class for increasing your average. she is funny and help ful outside of class. way to go", "No Comments", "Great course to take (esp. to bump up your mark)..class is very interesting!!..prof is funny and enthusiastic....BUT outside of class, it is a little hard to get help from her..probably because she is so busy..she seemed a little more nice in class than when we went to her office..", "She seems interested in the material but has an awful time getting the main points across to the class. Answers redundant questions from the same people every class, which is why people get distracted!", "Very cool prof. For sure one of the best. Makes things easy to understand.", "An overall great prof. She's very clear in explaining stuff plus she's nice, pretty, and she has a sweet and sexy voice.", "Best prof in 3rd Year, I thought I did better on the essay than what I expected. She actually raised my mark from what the TA originally assigned. She is really helpful, replies to your email the very same day!", "Essay was marked too hard. Honestly though, who knew we had to APA the title page and that it would be marked out of 5&#63; That was ridiculous. This is a third year class...not a PhD class. Great prof...but needs to take it down a level.", "midterm was really tough...why do i get the feeling she is trying to knock us down from last term.  and stop bashing Ms.Owens, just because she was structured and followed through with her promises doesn't make her an easy prof!", "Seems tough", "Seems like a really nice lady, but a bit of a dissapointment as I used last semester as a yardstick to guage this one. Will see how I feel after the grades come in.", "very good lecturer", "She seems nice but she really needs to post the lecture notes online. It's stressful trying to copy down all notes from the overhead and listening to what she's saying at the same time (Only one thing can be done properly) Copying down notes makes lecture less enjoyable than what it could be.", "Great prof! really enthusiastic, personable and fun. Essay is hard, but she expects alot from her students and i completely respect that, it challenges us to improve. Test were reasonable, and she tailored the course to what we wanted to learn.", "No Comments", "Good stuff", "The term essay was really hard", "Excellent...simply the best.", "Best course I ever took...way to go Dr. V!!!!", "Dr. V should be commended for her hard work and dedication that she has put forth in both her lectures and commitment to b&b. Mac is lucky to have such an amazing prof!", "Good class, even better prof!!!", "Excellent...very nurturing and smart!", "Interesting last comment considering she is not even teaching this term.  It is unfortunate that she is trying to do someting good for others (B vs B)and this is what you write!", "Tracy is a captivating speaker, but comes across as rather narcissistic and self-absorbed. Fairly shallow, as well..", "Tracy is amazing!!", "Dr. Vaillancourt is a great teacher. Enthusiasm and humour resound. REALLY READ YOUR TEXT. Always laugh at her jokes. Set yourself apart by talking with her-her marking isn't unbiased. She is completely meticulous re assignments-ATTN 2 detail will help.", "Amazing!", "Good prof. Interesting lectures. Exams are fair, but she marks hard on the paper (atleast that's how I found)", "great prof.  wish every class could be like hers.", "Does her job as a prof, but can be really ****y when you talk to her outside the classroom......but knows her stuff well overall.", "Excellent professor", "Dr. V is amazing!  She makes you think, and obviously passionate about what she does!  Top 2 profs I've had in my 4 years at MAC! Highly recommend!", "I don't think anyone can teach Abnormal Psychology better than Tracy. She's great.", "Awesome prof! Makes everything so clear and easy to understand.

Won't mark you well often but class was informative", "Did not like this prof. Drawn me away from philosophy. Boring, stuck up, poor marking, biased heavily on his own views. Will not take again", "Most terrible philosophy professor I ever had in York. Whatever the grade you receive in his course will be one grade lower than the other courses.  He is a nice person and a good lecturer, but not a good professor. He never encourage students. Even you attend every class and particpates in discussions, you won't  get a higher grade. Avoid!", "Made the course enjoyable and I actually learned. He gives you the grade you deserve so don't try to hand in last minute papers and expect an A. He does a lot of in class activites which help you understand the content he just presented. His lectures usually end 30min-1hr early but nonetheless his persona (reminds me of Sheldon from TBBT) is great", "Whether you are looking for a bird course or looking to learn and get adequate grades, avoid this prof. He will not appreciate your efforts or knowledge. Stuck up in his own ideals and fails to grasp reality. Be prepared to write a lot and get downgraded on everything. He will mark you down. Zero flexibility or appreciation of student needs. Avoid!", "Not recommended at all. Ok as a lecturer, but terrible marker. Assigns insane amount of work. Over 15000 words worth of papers for a 3 credit course. Lectures get boring quickly. Steer clear of this one, at least until he comes back to reality. Does not realise that students have other courses and things they need to do.", "A nice person and lecturer, but excessive marker and does not fully appreciate the workload he assigns. The course load included one paper (around 3000 words), 2 summaries (3000 words total), and stoic week (3500 words written within 7 days). All for 3 credit course. The grading is also harsh. Your average will probably suffer. This is for York Uni", "One of the best professors in York university. Clear outline of the material and provides clear slides in every lecture. Break things down so it is easy to understand for everyone. Course has some homework, which is easy (provided you read) and provides bonus marks to boost your average. Need more profs like him at York University!", "Good prof, explains everything really well. Content of the course seems simple and homework questions are easy but the quizzes are very hard. Gives chances for bonus marks to add to the quizzes. Overall interesting course but wouldn't take it again.

Do your readings, attend tutorials and you'll do well!", "Quirky dude with a clear and concise  understanding of the content material .  The potential list of readings themselves are literal philosophical paper, so get ready to understand them and read a lot (However, Stephan makes the content SO much more clearer).

Really great class and an even better prof!", "Very approachable!", "Very relevant lectures, intelligent, knowledgable, accommodating, professional, funny, helpful.", "This class killed my GPA. Marking is very subjective by TA's. Exam worth 35% that they also mark hard. Avoid with your life. Worst decision I made in first year.", "Rodde is great, his lecturing style is crystal clear, he always lets your know what is expected. For essays, exams, or roundtable discussions, the instructions are always clear and he was always around to help! The lectures were interesting, the class was fun to go to, and he is the reason I decided to get into philosophy!", "Not sure why everyone is complaining about this course...the readings were interesting, my TA was a good guy, and Rodde was a great lecturer.  He does a good job of laying out all interpretations of the readings/issues and letting students take it from there.  Would recommend.", "An amazing professor! Funny and he clearly knows his stuff. The lectures were extremely helpful, and he provided all the information necessary to get a good mark on the exam and the papers. An excellent professor, I can't wait to have him again!", "The absolute best professor (and course) I had first year. Very funny, helpful in and out of class, and extremely engaging. I might be a little bit biased because I love logic, but.... how can you NOT love logic?!", "Awesome prof. Really clear and VERY helpful when you ask him for help. He is not an overly easy marker but he is fair.", "Was not excited to be in a philosophy course to begin with but Rodde made me love it. Went to every class. The content of the course was always relevant. He's awkward but funny. His expectations in regards to assignments are crystal clear. He's a great professor and well versed in his material. Definitely recommend taking a course with him!", "Good teacher, funny guy. Could be a bit more interesting within class. Very quiet and sometimes hard to hear. Course has taught me things I would have never learnt before.", "Avoid him. Incrediby difficult. I got a 50 for a first year philosophy course when I'm an A student getting A's in everything else. He is brutal.", "Regret taking this. Brutal class and TAs. Average is a C.", "He's an okay prof, but never posts any of his lecture notes. The courseware pack readings are long and super boring--I never read any of them fully. TAs tend to either make or break you, as they mark everything. I also hated how 1B03 basically became environmental philosophy, nothing to do with law (or whatever the misleading course title says).", "Avoid this class. I had a 3.7+ gpa and got a D. The TAs in this class are terrible. I had Noel Iverson. Worst mistake of my life.", "He is very organized and very intelligent. He doesn't post his slides, but I find this very helpful as it forces you to come to class, and doing so I ended up doing well in a subject I don't tend to excel in. The essays were difficult but the exam was fair. He is a great prof!", "Great guy, crazy smart. Essays were tough.", "Really nice prof and always very willing to help. Very approachable. I noticed earlier comments that complained about him being disorganized, but I have found that his class is run very smoothly - he posts good lecture notes and assigns regular practice problems that are later taken up in class. I think he is an excellent prof overall.", "Funny, engaging, and extremely insightful. He thinks quickly of the perfect answer to your question, and marks very fairly. If you think you were marked badly, prove it to him- if you can, you'll get an improvement.", "Best prof at Mac... his courses are extremely interesting. He gets right down to the point, and always has an interesting remark after every idea is presented. He has inspired me to pursue philosophy. He is also awkward, and makes hilarious jokes. Take his classes if you can!", "Love him! He's kind of awkward, but that's part of his awesome personality. He has REALLY helped me out by providing to my special needs. He gave us the questions for the exam, which is always helpful. Really interesting prof. Although, he answers a LOT of student questions which takes away sometimes from him.", "He's amazing. He never stutters and never goes on tangents; he gets straight to the point and is interesting and compelling. He may be awkward but that's what makes him so down to earth. Really enjoying his class, even if it is a bit tricky.", "Rodde is the best Prof ever. A lot of my professors are concerned with people talking/attendance.. and stupid things like that. Rodde just gets down to business, delivers what you need to know, keeps it interesting, engages with the class, and throws in some lame jokes! His classes are highly enjoyable.. .definitely my favourite prof.", "Comes off as sweet/eager to please most of the time; hard to dislike. Enthusiastic about material. Marking more subjective than you'd expect seeing tests/assignments. Can be a bit out of line w/mockery (i.e. using past student's desperate begging to pass class as logical fallacy example for class to laugh at) but seems more awkward than malicious.", "Although I found the course material interesting, Rodde was disorganized and unable to explain concepts clearly. Avoid if possible.", "if u are smart u will do good. ps waht a sexy man", "He taught this course for the first time, and he screwed up a little bit. But he accepted his mistakes and tried to make amends for it. And that is characteristic of a good prof! If you put forth a GOOD argument for why your test answer is plausible, he would actually accept it. His notes were detailed and he posts really good summaries of them.", "PROS: He is very knowledgeable, and came to class well-prepared. He is down to earth, likable and identifies with student concerns easily. CONS: He is a young prof who had not taught this course before, and it showed. There was poor organization and planning of tests and assignment. But I am confident that he will quickly improve in these areas.", "Dr. Rodde is a great prof who is passionate about his course material. People who tend to dislike him are usually just people who tend to dislike the course, or are themselves at fault (IE, I encounter people who accuse him of not making expectations clear, but never themselves paid attention in class).", "This professor destroyed my interest in the course material. He made several offensive comments. He was unorganized and unable to explain concepts without being confused by the question being asked. He taught directly from the lecture notes, but these notes often had mistakes. I would not recommend this professor, although the course is required.", "He's good at teaching- he explains concepts clearly and keeps it interesting. However, he is extremely disorganized when it comes to planning tests, assignments, etc. Expectations regarding tests and assessments are rarely clear, which is unnecessary and nerve-wracking. Sometimes his marking is far too difficult, subjective, and unfair.", "awesome prof. loved his lectures and discussions even though they were regurtitations of the courseware.", "I had him for a technology philosophy class first year as well, and I must say he is the best professor I have experienced so far.

Insightful.", "Great professor for 1E03. The lectures were very informative and helped understand the textbook readings. Greatly encouraged ideas and comments from the class.

He was an excellent one-on-one educator.", "say what you will about his personality, his biggest flaw in terms of teaching is a complete inapproachability. people were too scared to takl in his class, we wouldn't allow himself to be challenged. instead of learning, and sharing knowledge, we had to adopt all of his general thoughts and quote them on the exam.", "Problems with Phil was course- MEAN TEACHER. Used raping women and killing babies for all examples during class and didn't realised that it could affect females in class.

Bad teacher although easy.", "Most illogical and frustrating lectures I've ever attended. Uses bad examples and is often contradictory in his justifications for opinions.

She's very enthusiastic when she teaches. Overall a good first year chem prof.", "Pippa Lock is honestly one of the most amazing professors at mcmaster. She is very smart, and keeps things simple. She takes you step by step through concepts in chemistry and moves very slowly. and she is very interactive with the class. She also jokes a lot. She also Doesn't proceed until everyone in the room understands. Her passion is teaching.", "Absolutely amazing. She made my first year chemistry experience totally worth it. There were like 300 people in that class, and she ran the class so that faster learners weren't held back and slower learners weren't left behind. Absolutely brilliant in chem and teaching.", "She's such a wonderful person! I regret not dropping in for her office hours because she seemed like a person you just want to get to know. Aside from that, she definitely knows the material inside & out, and doesn't carry on until she feels all 360 students in the room know the content. Her exam was challenging, but fair. So lucky to have had her!", "Amazing professor and an amazing person. Always ready to help you  no mattter what and teaches wonderfully too. If you have the option, take her class and make the time to go to her office hours!!", "It really doesn't get any better than Dr. Lock.

I loved the fact that when we had questions she would open it up to the entire lecture hall to answer as opposed to only herself answering the questions most of the time.

Lectures are engaging and in depth even at 8.30 on a Wednesday morning. Shows the actual science experiments which his is describing a historical context in class which is brilliant. Overall great professor who gives interesting and engaging courses.", "The lectures have a lot of information and his gives long examples, but this really help with understanding. Tutorials are great as long as you have read at least one of the articles. Very passionate lectures and every thing is online in case you miss something.", "Egan is a young environmentalist with a PHD. He talks a mile a minute and runs with his amazing slide shows, knowledge and charisma. Tedious off the wall assignments will ruin the momentum. Online group projects collecting hundreds of newspaper clippings with unknown software will be a too good to be true revelation. Essay instructions are vague ", "One of my favourite profs. That being said his assignments are unconventional which makes the difficult. But his lectures well make you take a step back and reevaluate the world you thought you live in.", "In lecture it sounds like hes lecturing less and reading off speech cards he made at home the night before. Feels like story time with a couple of big words thrown in. His assignment instructions are very unorganized and it seems as though he always has to send mass emails constantly explaining them. Would not recommend taking this course.  ", "I had Egan in both undergrad and graduate school. He's a really nice guy, and clear on what he expects- until he flips the table on you. All his courses are packed with great learning, but sometimes his ambitions exceed realistic outcomes, especially in his seminars. I'd say if you're a motivated, detail-oriented learner, his courses are for you.", "Very smart man, nice guy too.  Lectures were great and informative.  He can get a little too ideological at times (very left-wing) but isn't pretentious at all.  Would definitely recommend him to anyone.", "Such a great professor! He's very passionate about what he teaches and is helpful and approachable. The lectures are really interesting and the little jokes he throws in make it that much more enjoyable. The books were good reads and inexpensive. I will definitely be takeing his other classes in the future!", "A great professor. Makes everything clear and coherent. Very helpful and approachable. He adds humour in his lectures which makes them more interesting.", "I actually have no recollection of the course code - it was a third year seminar style class on the history of science and its relation to social responsibility. Egan runs an incredible seminar, not pretentious, makes you feel heard and that your ideas are worthwhile. You definitely need to be on top of course material on a weekly basis.", "Probably the coolest professor you'll meet, just talk to him if you're having any problems and he'll help you out.  Great teaching philosophy - his lectures aren't about scribbling down each detail, you just need to get a grip on the main concepts and the material he provides takes it from there.", "Overall a good professor.

His lectures are fast and extensive, but he puts it all online. It's really easy to contact him, and you'll want to--cause he's the coolest guy. His humour, and the interest he applies to his lectures make you love his class. Seriously, hard--but worth it.", "Course materials over $300. I would NEVER take another course with him based on that. That is ridiculous. He is kind of funny, but his classes are very hard. I thought it was WAY too hard for second year. Too many little assignments, too much reading. Helpful if you need him, but doesn't seem too approachable. Lectures very clear.", "egostistical crowd pleaser, his self-depreciating humour that he thinks is funny is annoying and i actually tend to believe the open criticisms he makes about himself.", "-passionate about material -cares about student progress - very approachable - informative - too many readings and assignments worth too little - discussions tended to digress from material making you wonder why you're paying 900$ all in - should be better next year as a lecture instead of discussion class - be interested or don't take it", "Very well-informed prof. Easy to approach, easy to talk to, lectures quite well. However, in this course there are TOO MANY LITTLE ASSIGNMENTS.

It is easy to do well in this class if you hand stuff in and go to tutorial.  Powerpoint is helpful-BECAUSE IT IS ON-LINE(thank-God) He puts too much info in the lecture, and not enough of whats very important.  BE INTERESTED IN THE TOPIC or else lectures get boring.", "I enjoyed his class, he is pretty enthusiastic and he covers different material than you would expect, but still keeps it relevant and informative.  The assignments were challenging, the second one more so than the first, but it is still possible to do well on them.  Exam was straight forward an easy.  Makes use of WebCT which is nice to see.", "His lectures force you to draw your own conclusions, as opposed to just handing them out. I understand why some people won't like that, but I found it refreshing to have to think and listen at the same time. He is definitely passionate about the material he teaches. Combine that with his low tech skills, and you have an old school lecturer.", "ridiculous reading assignments for essays - lectures don't match readings - hard to understand --&gt; they tell us in our essay's to answer the &quot;so what&quot; question; for this course, i'm still wondering.", "I find it hard to follow his lecture along with his slides, which somewhat disinterests me in the material.

Would definitely take a class of hers again!", "Balcom was decent, but lectures felt somewhat unorganized, and she was often all over the place.  If you study hard for the exams, you'll be rewarded.  Workload similar to any other history class.  My main issue was that I felt Balcom did not give us a general 'survey' of US history, as she often focused solely on minority groups.  Class was a 710", "I've taken three classes with Dr.B.  She is passionate about what she teaches and has her own unique teaching style. In her classes she provides a lot of help with research and defines her assignments and expectations clearly. She is VERY approachable and always helps students. she's amazing. You should take her classes, but you will work.", "Dr. Balcom was ok. I never got my marks for my last assignment. She said she would email me them, but they ended up going to another student. ", "She is one of the most approachable people. I found most professors I've had socially awkward, but Dr. Balcom is young and a cool person. She's just friendly; yes it's true, she's a hard marker, but what do you expect people to have things handed to you? I think she pushes us to the best of our ability. She's highly intelligent and a great person.", "She is amazing, best professor I have EVER had. If I could recommend one thing to any student it would be TAKE DR BALCOM'S CLASSES. She's easy to get along with, she's super nice and adorable. If I walk into a lecture and see Karen as my professor again, I'll be the happiest person at Mac!

Seems very passionate about her career choice and does a great job at it! Young, enthusiastic, extremely nice lady, and someone who truly deserves being called Doctor! Loved her! ", "Dr. Balcom is one of my favourite professors in the history department. She goes out of her way to help students understand material and point them in the direction or lend students to research material. Her marking was a little slow this year, but her material was interesting and you could clearly tell she is passionate about what she teaches.", "I found Dr. B to be very unprofessional. She would emailed each of us our feedback on assignments...except she sometimes sent us someone else's. I was not impressed by this at all. Our marks are confidential and McMaster has email policies for this exact reason.

Avoid being in close quarters with her. Her personality seemed very closed off. She was always trying to turn her students into leaders, whatever that means. The world is not lacking in people trying to create a cult of followers Balcom! Very aristocratic attitude in my opinion.", "She is excellent.So impressive it kind of brings tears to my eyes.Karen really goes out of her way to help the students that need her.She has her hands in what seems like everything around the city but she still makes time to help you progress.She's charming and lively as a lecturer.Members of last year's 2hi3 still reminisce over our time with her", "I happened to once overhear Dr. Balcom speaking with a student in her office. He seemed to have little clue about the work but Dr. Balcom spoke with respect, utilizing a problem-solving approach. This is the same kind of experience I had with her. She went way beyond the call of duty to be helpful and generous. She is also exceptionally organized.", "Dr. Balcom was not a great prof. Maybe it was the 9/8:30 lectures, but it was tough keeping up with her: she jumped around a lot, and always assumed you had read the text book. She was fond of selecting obscure topics for her exam-essays.", "She was ok sometimes i did not understand her leaching its not very clear but still ok", "Class was definately difficult, but she was a good prof. Hard to keep up in her lectures sometimes, but very clear and friendly. Goes out of her way to help her students. Put all textbooks on 2 hour reserve in library so you didn't have to buy them - I love her for that. Very approachable, cares about the students.", "I absolutely refuse to take another class with her as professor.", "Dr. Balcom is one of the best, if the not best professor within McMaster's Department of History. Although she is quite difficult and challenging, Dr. Balcom goes out of her way to ensure that students succeed. She is extremely approachable and frequently lends out her personal books or meets with students outside of office hours.", "She's very nice and cares about her students. Her lectures are good but I found she tended to let her own biases/interests dominate the subject material.", "Don't take a seminar with this prof. She picks favourites and is a total *****.", "I thought Karen was a fanatstic prof! Her lectures were interesting and straightforward.  She's very approachable and seems to genuinely enjoy engaging with students. She went out of her way to help me with the major essay. I would definitely take another class with her!", "Seems like a nice lady, but her lectures are incredibly dry and boring. She's better than Dr. Frager though.", "The worst professor I have ever had and I am in third year. Boring lecturer (reads the notes she posts online and calls it a 'lecture'). Not approachable, kicked me out of her office twice so she could do prep work for the class. HELLO! OFFICE HOURS ARE FOR ME TO ASK QUESTIONS AND YOU TO EXPLAIN AND ANSWER! I didn't learn anything unfortunately.", "Great lecturer - bit of a **** one on one though. Maybe it was just a clash of personalities but we actually had a rather heated arguement in her office once, and she was very rude! I'm sorry, aren't you supposed to be above verbally abusing 2nd years&#63; I'm only 20, for christs sake!", "Balcom is a likeable, enthusiastic prof who is very effective at reaching her students.  She is young, endearing, intelligent, and got me interested in US History - something I thought impossible.

Kind of intimidating/condescending", "This course was actually very useful to understand the Monte Carlo method & applications, but it's probably the hardest undergraduate statistics course offered at Mac. Assignments: very hard, time consuming. Midterms: very tricky, hard to do well. Had like 20 people at the beginning, ended with around 8. It's basically a grad level course. Audit.", "4ci3 should be easy, but canty made it really hard. And why do we have to prove R code???", "I regret taking this course for credit. Why so many reviews about this professor are about how handsome he is? That's not what people normally write when they come to rate a professor.", "Canty's test are long and tough. And for some reasons, it's only 45 mins. He uses unclear notations for linear regression so the lecture notes dont really help. 3A3 is a starting course for linear regression so it's easy to get confused by his notations. Canty is a serious tough grader. And his TA for this course has a strong accent.", "Okay teaching, bad personality, not really approachable, arbitrary expectations especially with R code, long and tough assignments. He does know his statistics though.", "Awesome... He's excellent and explains everything with example with R computing.... One of the best in Computational Statistics.....", "I agree with all the positive comments this prof receives. Socializing with this prof is better than being at the Play boy mansion surrounded by hundreds of beautiful women. With Angelo Canty, it's a match made in heaven. What a wonderful person.", "Canty is the best statistics professor in the entire Universe. He is a true statistician. People who complain they don't like him or his tests being too lengthy should drop out of University. He is the most fair and caring prof on campus. Plus if you smoke with him outside of Hamilton Hall, you can easily become his friend. He is my best friend.", "I had this prof for Stats 1CC3 some time ago and I have to give him credit for  making me love that course. I continued on and took second year stats courses this year, but the quality of profs I had for 2D03 and 2MB3 was not upto the level that Canty is.

Cares for students so much that even your own parents wont care for you, as much as he cares for his students. Unbelievably good attitude towards teaching and students. The only complaint is tests were a bit long but assignments is easy 30% and final exam is long but very fair. Outstanding Professor.", "I heard he is going to be the chair of math and stats very soon. I hope the rumours are true because he deserves it.", "He looks like Ron Jeremy. Amazing prof with HUGE PASSION for statistics", "HE WAS AMAZING", "Good prof but the tests were too long for 50 minutes. Final was fair.", "AMAZING PROF", "Outstanding in terms of teaching and lecturing. The coolest prof at MAC! He has a pony tail which is awesome. Also looks cute in his picture on this site.", "Most well organized and best dressed prof I had. He is great. He has a great sense of humour!! People who write bad things about him and complain of him being too difficult should not be studying at University and have low I.Q and don't deserve to do University level studies, because he is one of the easiest and most fair instructors. Keep it up.", "In my opinion he is the ONLY  prof at McMaster who actually thinks the success of his students and generating interest in stats is his responsibility. He puts a lot of effort into teaching and his lecture notes are proof of this fact. Great prof. Wish there were more like him!!!", "He is very kind and very fair. Very under-rated prof. He deserves a huge raise. I hope that in the near future he becomes the chair of Mathematics and Statistics department, and eventually, president of McMaster. I will nominate him for President of McMaster or even better Prime Minister of Canada. He has leadership qualities and deserves the best.", "Great prof, but more then that, an exceptional human being, which is a more important quality. Has genuine concern about your education, your future, and your interest in his course. Will do everything he can to help students.

A gem of a professor.", "He is such a great prof I cannot explain in words how awesome he is. if you want to take a statistic course I recommend you take ONLY WITH DR.CANTY AND NOBODY ELSE...switch your sections to his class, if you have the chance, he will make you love stats he is really that good he is very kind heart human being who cares for his students so much.

McMaster would be an awesome place if there were more profs like him!!! A+++ for Dr. Canty", "Greatest instructor that has stepped foot on mcmaster campus ever since this University was born. He is not a professor, he is a STATISTICS ANGEL. His lectures give me motivation to become like him one day. He has so much passion for statistics that it rubs on, on students, makes you want to do stats homework 24/7 just because of this super prof!!", "Greatest teacher I have met in my first year at McMaster. I hope one day I will be like him! I wish him a successful career at mac. Wish there were more good profs like him. He is much better than Dr. Childs for sure.", "Dr. Canty should be promoted to head of the math and stats department!", "He is a good prof and a beautiful person with a heart of gold. He types up all his Assignment solutions and tests, shows how much hard work and effort he puts into teaching. Takes his job very seriously and strives to be fair in all aspects. Sometimes tests are a bit long. Has lot of office hours available for students, but people never show up =)", "All around good prof, I would love to take any course taught by him when I get to upper year courses.", "He is my favourite statistics professor. My love for stats and inspiration to take more stats courses stemmed from his class. Really he has motivated and sparkled my interest in stats. I saw him smoking outside Hamilton Hall few days back and today I saw him in the student center near Tim Hortons hahaha lol", "He teaches so well - other professors should take an example from him.", "It seems that he is less hostile and self-centre this year (you can compare the rating history), may be it is time for his tenure track position review, so it is very likely that he has changed just for a purpose. If he really decided to treat his students better, I hope he will continue this change in attitude even after he got his tenure.", "OUTSTANDING", "Great lecturer, nice lecture slides.", "A difficult person to deal with ... very unpredictable.", "He is not professor, he is really an angel professor. I dont know how anybody can give him bad ratings or bad comments, he is the BEST statistics professor. I strongly encourage everybody to enroll in canty's course. VERY VERY VERY FAIR PROFESSOR", "Excellent professor till now. His lecture notes are as good as gold and his teaching is very effective and very very clear. He really knows statistics upside down", "Very helpful professor. Most students are intimidated to see him during office hours because they are scared he will get angry. He has provided sample tests for practice, and the actual test was exact same level of difficulty. Has genuine concern for his students. Class average was quiet high for the Stats2Mb3 course. He is very well organized.", "greatttt guy", "Excellent prof. His tests were more than fair in this course. They were reasonable in length and medium level of difficulty. He provides sample tests and even provided a sample final exam with solutions to help us prepare. His course notes are excellent and so much easier than the textbook. His Assignments were long and hard, but still doable.", "Best prof I have ever had. Really makes the students think but the exams are similar to practice questions assigned.", "tests were so hard", "Toughest professor in the history of the math dept. His tests are the worst nightmare.", "Well, he seemed quite abrasive at first but the key with Dr. Canty is persistence. The more you show up at his dorr, the less snippy he gets. The course would've been great if it weren't for the ridiculous tests. If the tests were going to be that hard then we should have gotten more time.", "This prof is the most unreasonable prof i have ever met. first his midterms are incredibly hard, i mean they are 40x harder than the one from last year, and the one from the year before. no time to do them in the time he allows, and he wont curve the mark. take this course in summer, AVOID him at all costs.", "hes the most messed up prof EVER !", "His assignments are extremely difficult, and his tests are insanely hard and unreasonably long for finishing in 50 minutes. He is the most unfair and unreasonable prof you will ever find.", "This prof is super hard. I was taking his class this term and then i realize i'm not taking in anything. His assignments are ridiculously hard, and help from him is pretty much no help at all. Even if you tried to get help, the feeling u get when u ask a question..u will feel intimidated. I dropped it and hopefully i get a different one for summer.", "This professor is definitely one of the worst.  He is not helpful and responsible to his students.  He gave very hard and infeasible tasks to all levels (both undergrad and graduate students).  He is a selfish guy and always not available, don't take his course or get him as your supervisor if you have a choice.", "difficult to understand", "Brutal prof. Probably the toughest math prof ever.", "VERY VERY VERY hard professor. Never take any course he teaches. Absolutely brutal.", "Worst prof in Canada (and Canada is a big country!) not approachable inside AND outside of class; seems to be depressed. can't explain things at all.

She should at least have more! -She doesn't post everything she shows on the slides -GPA killer in my opinion", "Going into Dr. O's class I was pretty skeptical of how the semester was going to go based on what I've heard about her, and I was pleasantly surprised. Honestly, as long as you go to class and do your work, it's not a challenging course. I found her tests to be pretty fair with no surprise content, and she was engaging and interesting in lecture.", "Shes a great prof! Loved her in both of the classes she taught, but the midterms were SO hard, and I studied more for them than I have for anything else. You absolutely need to go to class if you want to pass!!", "Really hard because it is not taught well. This class needs a tutorial and has only 3 ta's for over 300 students. The TA's often have to ask each other for answers. The exams are like two part riddles, very easy theories but they need to be applied and I found not well explained. There is no review. The textbook is secondary to lecture. Useless.", "Unapproachable and not helpful", "SUCKS. Abrupt and sometimes rude, you cannot miss 1 class. No support in the class at all, she says in the first class that if you email her she will delete it. If you have the chance to skip this class, do.", "Dr. Ostovich somehow manages to make the most boring-sounding course interesting. Shes organized, clear, funny, and always willing to help students. I love her testing style  it actually forces you to understand the material, not just memorize it.", "Genuinely enjoyed her lecture style, found it very easy to remember content thanks to her many examples. Big focus on experiments in Social Psych. Havent taken a course with her that required short answers so found tests very fair and not overly difficult if you understood the content and attended lectures.", "Only graded by two tests and the exam, nothign to boost your mark. Her tests were much harder than everyone expected and brought down a lot of averages", "She is a good lecturer but, when she grades you... :(  she is one of the hardest marking professors I have had in my 4 years at McMaster. Let's just say there is a reason why she is known as the GPA killer.", "Really good at teaching, she is funny and teaches in a conversational tone. Easy to follow slides and examples. Really tough tester, it's almost all short answer and looking for very specific answers.", "I think Dr. O is a great prof. She explains things really well and is always engaging. With that said, she is easily the hardest marker I've ever had. I would study so much and get 50's and 60's. I understood the content too, it's just that her questions are way too specific. Don't take her classes if you need a good GPA.", "Poor Dr. O! I think she's an amazing lecturer, and this is the second class I've taken with her. I think she cares about her students doing well and she's hella funny and interesting but i have to agree and say her marking scheme is too specific. So much so, that even if you understand the concept, you might not do well. Love you Dr. O but help us!", "Dr. O is a great person and approachable after lecture. She makes lectures interesting & funny!! BUT can often be unclear/confusing. Tests are difficult to do well on bc of precision required in the short answers. You need to read textbook for m/c and lecture notes for the s/a. All grades were not released going into the exam which sucked.", "Exams were very tricky. Really poor wording/structure of questions on exams. Also, lectures were not structured very well either, I found them to be all over the place and my notes were hard to follow.", "Dr. O made us work but I learned more in her class than any other undergraduate courses! To be honest, I am only realizing now that I am in my first year Masters that Dr. O had prepared me for this... If you are serious about learning and succeeding in graduate studies later, Dr. O is the real prof for that.", "Very condescending and unapproachable. Seems to genuinely make an effort to make testing overly difficult for students by creating vague, open-ended questions that require an unbelievably specific response. Lectures were fairly organized, but it seemed like testing was just designed to set you up for failure, which she almost seems to enjoy.", "If you hate textbook readings or skip lectures, this class is not for you. Tests were difficult and the workload compared to other classes is very heavy.", "This prof is a good teacher and explains things well, but the way that she tests sets everyone up to fail.", "Not a fan of this prof. The way she teaches is extremely disorganized and there is no structure to anything. In addition, her tests are brutal and ask solely for definitions of random words. Also, she has such a rude attitude towards students/teaching. Avoid taking a class with this prof if you can.", "She is very unnaproachable, unflexible, unwilling to meet with students, rude, condescending, and her evaluations solely test your ability to memorize information. I thought PNB was an amazing program until I took this course. It needs a new prof to teach it.", "Honestly, I don't think Dr. Ostovich has the compassion that is required of a teacher. She constantly makes condesending and demeaning remarks, and is extremely unnaproachable. In addition, she doesn't make the time to address students' questions (through office hours). If you're looking for a mentor, look somewhere else.", "Record the lectures. She says the definitions once and very quickly, and they are not in the slides or anywhere else. You will need to use the key words on the tests, and the bulk of the marks rely on you having these memorized. The key to the tests is having the definitions memorized. She lacks humility, so she is difficult to approach.", "Dr. Ostovich teaches Research Methods in an interesting and engaging manner. However, her testing is quite difficult. She only takes specific answers, and memorization is a huge component of the course. It is difficult to approach her, and she is often very busy and does not make time to go over tests with students.", "You need to attend lecture to do well, textbook is supplementary but M/C taken from there. Dr. O has been really great at answering emails and is very approachable in class. The content itself is not especially difficult, but Dr. O has designed the course to be challenging. Often has to repeat her definitions many times in class bc they are unclear", "Not a fan of this prof. Her attitude seemed rude towards students, which made the lecture unpleasant to attend. Also midterms were very harshly marked, even though I studied extremely hard and thought I knew most of what was being asked.", "I've taken three courses with Dr. Ostovich and I can confidently say she is one of the best professors I've had. Her lectures are extremely well-organized, are easy to understand, and have great flow. Her teaching style makes the content interesting and engaging. Would definitely recommend any course taught by her; truly great prof.", "Don't like her rude attitude, demeanour, and condescending treatment of students. Material itself was fairly straightforward. Tests a lot of detail from textbook readings as well. Seems cynical and hates her teaching life because she didn't make being a real physician or lawyer. Not accommodating. Very unapproachable and strict with marks. Too bad.", "Very lecture heavy. But really fascinating topics! Just her rude demeanour, attitude, cynical tone, and condescending manners made this course unenjoyable. Material is okay to grasp, but her midterms can be hit or miss, need some deciphering. Take this course if you have some wiggle room in your GPA. Is unrelenting and unforgiving for your concerns", "Tests are killer, but easily one of the best profs I have ever had! I have learned so much from her, and still remember what she taught long after the class was finished. I always looked forward to coming to her lectures, she's super funny and always engaging", "I have taken several classes with Dr. O & she's the best prof I've had at Mac. The tests aren't difficult if you understand the material - I've gotten an 11 or 12 in every class of hers I've taken without putting in any crazy amount of effort. Her classes are always interesting & I feel like I've actually learned things, rather than just memorizing", "Dr. O was possibly the best prof i've had at mac. amazing and interesting lectures, reminds me why i like psychology. very approachable. only time i've ever experienced meaningful class discussion/participation. i would take any class she offers. both her second yr courses were amazing, so interesting, and i loved listening to her", "This is my lowest mark going into exams. I took it as an elective i thought would be interesting and relatively easy. While it is interesting material, the multiple choice midterms are ridiculous. I have read 95% of assigned readings and gone to every class have a 71 going into the final - I'm usually a 83-88% student", "I adore Dr. Ostovich. Yes, her tests are hard if you are only able to regurgitate material; she wants you to really understand and think critically, which I like. She is an excellent lecturer. I have taken three classes with her now and have loved all of them.", "She's very passionate about what she's teaching and her lectures are great but her tests are kinda difficult. I ended up with a decent mark but definitely had to work for it. ", "If I could turn back time and avoid this class I would. Her lack of clarity on exams is frightening and stressful. She tells her students she amends her marking schemes as to almost imply that \"pretty much every student will do poorly\". It really is a set up for failure, especially when your prof explicitly mentions this to you the first day.", "3RM3 was the first class I had with Dr O.  I enjoyed her lectures, but the midterms were awful: most people ran out of time and the questions were vague. These vague questions required very specific answers. If you put something that was valid, but not in the answer key, you were out of luck. I tried really hard to do well, but it felt impossible.", "if you don't have to DON'T. ", "Overly difficult, her mid terms are a large guessing game, along with her short answer. If you can't get inside her head to figure out exactly what she wants and what she's thinking you won't do well at all.  The feel i get from this prof is \"I suffered to get my degree, so you shall too\", a slight cynical view on academia and doing well.", "Most difficult class I have taken, not because of the material, but because of the grading. The first exam, overly difficult, more of a riddle to figure out what she wants on the exam. MC hard because each question is the length of the page to read and has to much information to make a fast choice for the time given. You will struggle regardless.", "IF YOU CAN, AVOID HER CLASSES. I've taken a few classes with her, & I find she's a very polarizing prof. Many other students I've talked to absolutely dislike her, her demeanor, & her material. Personally, although I got decent grades in her courses, I found her extremely condescending to students at times & not helpful. Hard marker too.  ", "If you read the textbook and go to class you'll do well. She's the best lecturer I've ever had. Her courses are well worth taking. She even made child development interesting. Her tests are challenging but not impossible if you learn the material rather than memorize it.", "Loved her lectures, they were always very interesting. However, her testing style was not familiar to me. I got 50's on the two midterms, BUT- I created a new studying style in which I wrote a \"fake\" exam in order to prepare the exam and it worked wonders! I got a 72! Thank god. If you know how to properly study you'll do super well!", "Definitely one of the more interesting lecturers at Mac. She's funny and makes the material easy to understand, especially by using tons of examples of experiments. Tests are pretty difficult, but not impossible to do well if you study properly. ", "Her classes are always super interesting because she seems to be passionate about the material. Some people find her tests difficult, but in my opinion they're not so bad - as long as you know the theories presented in class (along with relevant experiments) and have read the textbook (~25% of questions are text based I believe).", "great prof but tests are ridiculous. its not that theyre hard, the questions are just stupid. The questions are always extremely vague, which allows you to kinda ramble about everything you know, then she complains that people are specific in their answers. claims we have to try to figure out what 'the question is asking' like some kind of riddle", "one of the best professors at Mac, works really hard to make sure students understand the material. Is really good a teaching material and makes questions that actually get you thinking!", "very clear teaching; fair but challenging tests", "She was the best prof ever! i enjoyed her lectures. However, her exams were HARD. It wasnt an easy course but i bet you would like the lectures.", "interesting class and a good prof. tests were not easy but no means hard. i finished with a decent grade w/o buying the text book. just attend lectures and you can get around mid 70s with ease.", "Best lecturer I've ever had! I always looked forward to going to her class. Not a bird course, but a very interesting one. If you pay attention and attend every lecture, you will do well.", "Amazing and engaging lecturer, but can definitely be blunt.  Encourages higher level thinking.  LOVED her testing style, one of my best university marks!", "Dr. O is a great prof :) Her lecture is every interesting and entertaining. It's a fun class but it's not so easy. YOU MUST MUST MUST GO TO CLASS. She tests mainly on lecture materials. Her tests are not easy, but fair.", "Incredible lecturer, I willingly attended every single class. She makes the material so interesting it just sticks naturally. Funny, engaging with her audience. Attendance is a must to do well.**", "Most people scared me by saying she was a tough prof but she was a really good lecturer! If you pay attention and understand the experiments and their significance from her lectures you will do well!! Her final exam had me rushing to finish, and had some very confusing question. Fair but not and easy class. and attendance is mandatory!!", "Hated this course as well as her teaching style. Tests are impossibly hard and she's a really fake person. I've seen and heard it first hand. By far my worse prof at Mac and that's saying a lot.", "Great prof; Class attendance is a must. One of my favourite profs at Mac. Classes are challenging, but she makes the material super interesting. Great lecturer. Classes are not for the weak willed or for slackers of any kind. No nonsense! Loved her.", "I think she is a very good lecturer, she makes the information interesting. Her tests can be difficult, but she provides tips on how to do well in her courses which I found helpful. As long as, you review the material regulary and think outside the box, you'll do well.", "Tests hard. Need to really know your stuff, memorization WILL NOT HELP YOU. That being said, Ostovich courses have been my favourite of all my psych courses.", "Good lectures, but impossible tests. DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. It's not worth the aggravation.", "Just told our class that we all failed the written part of our exam. If answers are not identical to her understanding of concepts then you will fail the class. Needs to understand that each student has their own way of identifying, understanding and communicating the material", "This is a course for those who are committed to a real university education: Dr. O is not going to baby you by testing exactly what she put on the power point. You must synthesize information from lecture, make good notes, read the textbook, and think critically about the material. If you are invested, you will have no trouble doing well.", "Great lecturer. She made the content very enjoyable and interesting. She's also very funny. Tests were difficult, but fair. Definitely need to attend lectures to do well", "Such  a great prof. so helpful/funny. However tests were so hard! i attended every lecture made study notes read the textbook and ended up with a 60 on the midterm. really really difficult. also her method of teaching was talk about the experiment and then extrapolate info rather than heres the concept and heres an experiment for evidence.", "Also took Psych 3AC3 with her. She is a great prof but her tests are brutal! The first midterm average was high 50s and she said that WE were doing something wrong. Second midterm average was only a few percent better.  It is VERY hard to get a good mark in her class. Try to avoid taking her class.", "Take this class if you want to fail!", "Extremely hard tests! Don not take this class unless you can make every single lecture. You can study for days for her tests and still end up with a mediocre mark. Not a bird course whatsoever, only enroll in this class if you are interested & committed in/to social psych. If not, your GPA will plummet.", "I loved her, she taught very good and her classes were extremely interesting. However, tests were impossible. I read all the material and attended every class and studied for weeks, and this was the only class I failed.", "in order to do well in her course you have to think like her and how she would answer the questions", "She's absolutely AMAZING! LOVED HER! She made me love Social Psychology and before that I had absolutely no interest in Social Psychology so that's saying something!", "An excellent and engaging lecturer who uses mostly experimental examples to teach the concepts. YOU MUST GO TO CLASS! All the valuable material is in what she says, not her powerpoints. Tests are very hard but not unfair; you can do well if you study and take an interest in the material.", "very interesting and I loved going to lectures. U HAVE TO ATTEND CLASS to get good notes otherwise youll be completely lost... her ppt's dont help at all if u dont attend class. her SA is hard and you have a v limited amount of time to write it all out. have to work very hard to get a 10! shes the only prof i can actually listen 2 w/out tuning out", "Enjoyed the class. I feel like I learn the most out of her lectures. Great prof.", "To date, this has to be my weirdest class. I studied the most and didn't do well. However, I love her lectures, and actually take classes she teaches because of her.", "Great teacher! Hard tests-you must know the exact words that is looking for to get marks!", "Tough.  Tricky, demanding tests.  She is a good prof in that she is organized, to the point, and knows what she's talking about.  She's tough, though.  I didn't enjoy her classes because I found her dry and felt that she glazed over certain things and did't assess them.  Not very receptive to questions.", "Worst class ever! The tests were far too long-nobody completed the first midterm. The marking was brutal-a C was a 'good' mark. If you didn't write exactly what the master answer was, you LOST marks. Very much 'my way or the highway' kind of prof-doesn't want to know what you know, wants to know how well you memorize what SHE knows.", "excellent prof. not very hard tests. awesome subject matter. loved the class :)", "Excellent Prof, lectures very well and she is very engaging. Tests are extremely fair. I would definitely recommend taking any of her classes", "Dr. O is awesome. Her explanations are crystal clear. Going to class is a must - and she keeps classes HIGHLY enjoyable. Her tests are a bit tricky if you're not used to it but shes great! :)", "Jennifer is an excellent prof! Honestly one of my favorites at McMaster and she does not deserve the negative ratings. I honestly didn't find her condescending once and the material was vary well taught. She was very helpful, went at a good pace, and her tests WERE NOT hard. If you go to class you'll do great! Don't be afraid of her!", "Extremely condescending. Midterm and exam questions are marked according to a rigid master answer which leave little to no room for variation. Tends to stray off topic during lecture.

Truly understanding prof and lectures are amazing. Gives specific pages for readings. He is abs great! Midterms are easy", "THE REAL DEAL. Great man, great prof. Sometimes he repeats stories he already told (I'm guessing he forgot he already told them) and it's so cute and funny, if a little flustering. He's so versed and knowledgeable and truly loves what he teaches. One of McMaster's gems.", "Simon Wood is extremely engaging, every class is fun to be in. Its definitely such an enjoyable elective. And every now and then, he blows your mind with cool facts. Textbook readings are given before every test and only questions from the pages he says show up on the test, so its not reading heavy. Definitely recommend this course and Music 2F03!", "One of the best classes I have ever taken! You DO not have to know anything about music to take this class. Prof is amazing.", "Amazing prof! He cares about all his students, and goes through every test again to make sure there was no mistakes. Lectures are very entertaining and you don't notice the time go by.", "VERY GOOD PROF", "he's hilarious, really passionate about what he teaches, and is very clear and concise. He wants students to learn and grow from this class, and you can tell he really enjoys teaching. 100% would recommend taking any class with him! doesn't post any lecture notes however so class attendance is pretty much mandatory", "I love this man! He's a great prof", "A true lecturer, knows his material inside out.  Really cares for his students, and lectures are so engaging you will never want to skip.

Readily answers questions given by the class & clarifies his information when asked :)", "Simon is phenomenal instructor. If you have the chance to attend one of his classes or be enrolled in his course I would highly recommend it. As an instructor you can really tell how passionate he is about this study. Simon is very intelligent and his teaching skills are far from boring. Lectures are mandatory but I guarantee you wont want to miss.", "Dr. Wood is an amazing professor. He is funny, respectful, knows his stuff and really teaches you what will be on the tests. He doesn't add in trick questions that he only touched on for a second. This was the second time taking this course as I failed the first time with a different prof, and thanks to Dr. Wood I passed and actually understood.", "One of the best professors at McMaster. I had the pleasure of taking Music 2II3 and loved the course. Then this term I took Music 2F03 (theatre and film) and didn't know who the prof was... when I saw him standing there, I cannot explain to you how happy I was to see him! Honestly, the best..", "Simon is a great teacher. The content was so interesting, i really learned a lot. He is a great story teller and just an all around great guy. He's so funny too, every week he had our entire night class cracking up (a difficult feat too, night classes are awful!). Will miss him!!", "This guy isn't a lecturer. He is a TEACHER! You actually leave class knowing the material instead of writing a bunch of stuff down. Best instructor I've ever had. Super nice guy and is hilarious. Very knowledgeable of course material.", "I would say he's an okay teacher, but his tests are not easy. Lots of textbook questions and lots of (A, A&C, B&C, all) type questions. He spent way too much time pre-WW2. The first test was basically all race & hillbilly music. The last class was the first time he talked about Zeppelin, which was a shame. I wouldn't take it again, and I love music", "A 350 word limit is not enough to explain how awesome this prof is! I am in my fourth year at Mac and I only wish that he could have taught all my classes! I learned so much from this one class. He is the true example of what a professor should be! He loves what he talks about and he will definitely make you love learning! Rock on Mr. Wood!", "In my 4 year university career, he is the only professor who taught me anything. Makes the whole course in to a story and effectively ties history and social movement into music. He is amazing. I wish the course was a full year class.", "Amazing! Interesting prof, hilarious, lectures appealing to ALL faculties. Easy assignment structure, genuinely cared about everyone. If you had a bad day, he told you to come talk to him, even if it had nothing to do with the class. Ignore older negative comments, as he openly struggled with depression. BEST PROF AT MAC, HANDS DOWN.", "LOVED DR. WOOD! Best man ever to teach at Mac!", "Best prof I ever had. Only class I went to all semester.", "Best prof I've had at Mac. Not only was he a phenomenal teacher but he took the time to give us advice about how to do well in university in general as well. Sometimes, he'd end his lectures with a little &quot;stay strong, my friends&quot; or &quot;use the force, trust your feelings&quot; in a joking kind of way but I would remember that for the rest of the day :)", "Best Prof. Best class.", "Take this class! It was at 930 in the morn, and I had no trouble getting to class. I was excited about what I would hear in music each day. Simon Wood is an amazing individual, he is so intelligent and really cares about his students. You come out learning SO much about how music influences society.

He makes every lecture fun and makes you want to attend class.", "Best prof out there! This class was so interesting and he knows so much about the music that you really want to attend just so you can hear all the extra tidbits. He is a cool guy too and it shows. I would totally sign up for any other class he teaches....in fact I started looking for one! He's got a great sense of humor too. Excellent!", "Very passionate about what he teaches and VERY interesting. His classes are ALWAYS fun and filled with anecdotes that get more than their fair share of laughs. His exams are a little more intense than expected. Attention is required in lecture and it shows on the exams. Overall, a wonderful course and worth the 3 hours of night class!", "The fact that this is my first time doing one of these ratings is a testament to how absolutely brilliant Simon Wood really is. Seriously, this man was born to teach- he lectures as if he is telling you a story, and his charm and wit ensure that you hang on to every word he utters. In a perfect world, he would be teaching every course at Mac.", ":)", "LOVE THIS GUY! =D", "AMAZING. One of the best profs at McMaster", "DOes anyone know what Dr. Wood's mcmaster email is&#63; please let me know! does he teach summer&#63; this summer&#63;", "This class is amazing! Dr. Wood is probably one of the best lecturers at McMaster. Very interesting material. The tests/exams were all M/C and a bit tricky but if you study you'll do well. Also, you have to go to every class as he doesn't post notes but you honestly don't want to miss it anyway. This guy can teach his pants off!", "Best professor and class i've had at McMaster.

NICE SHORTS!!", "awesome professor! favourite this year by far. keep up the great work (and jokes)", "AMAZING. BEST LECTURES EVER", "Good lecturer but HORRIBLE testing methods.  Multiple choice and unnecessary &quot;a or c, none of the above&quot; options that just trick you.  And the text is useless", "Awesome. Extremely knowledgeable, clear, and helpful. He takes time and goes through every step to make sure everyone gets it. Gives interesting and helpful feedback on assigments. I learned a lot in this class.

Dr. Woods is the best prof EVER!!!! So funny, and so smart! I loved the occasional &quot;BOOM GAH's&quot; and the obsession with KISS haha. What a great guy. I wish he could teach all of my classes!", "Thank you for making the class interesting and funny. I learnt so much, more than I did in my boring required classes.", "Most interesting class I have ever taken.  Simon made it actually enjoyable to attend lecture", "All and all he's alright...  A well-needed break from your average lecturer...", "Simon is an easygoing guy who tells it like it is; he makes class fun, despite all of the assignments that taking this course entails.  I hope to have him again next year!", "Best prof on campus. I took one of his courses, and every week I counted down the days until his next lecture. The following year, I took a course just because I knew he was teaching, and I had no clue about multi media stuff. Through how interesting he makes his lectures I came out with an A! Best prof of all time.", "Used to be cool, but something happened within the last year, and now he just doesn't care.  Never comes to class prepared, and don't even think about asking for help, because Dr. Ignoro Von Makes You Feel Crap (p.s. not actually a doctor), will do nothing but anger you and make you cry.  They even got rid of MIDI because he became useless.", "he was extremely annoying", "BEST PROF AT MAC!!! funny, incredibly intelligent, cares about his students, and will help you if you are in a bind.  If you are at mac, definitely take one of his classes.  You will never regret it.", "WHAT AN AWESOME TEACHER!Simon is by far the best prof I've encountered thus far. He inspires and captivates his students like no other. I would recommend everyone to take his course, music lover or not, b/c by the end of his class you will be more appreciative of music and it deep roots in culture.", "WHAT AN AWESOME TEACHER!Simon is by far the best prof I've encountered thus far.

Just take a S.Wood class and you'll see why people dig his material!", "Started out as the best prof ever in 2G03.  When I took 3C03 a year later Simon was the most apathetic person I'd ever met.  He rarely came to class prepared and didn't help anyone at all.  Very close minded and useless.  Stay clear.", "SIMON  WOOOD ROCKS!!!!!", "Is amazing, best lecturer i have had in my 5 years at Mac.  Learned alot and had fun doing it. oh yeah and just for kicks, so HOT!!!", "Wood is frikin'hilarious!!  He is one of the only profs, where I can sit through 3 hours of lectures and not get bored.  Two thumbs up!!", "I have never seen a classroom so full before this class- you have to come at least 10 min early to get a good seat. Everyone loves Simon! How could you not&#63; He's incredibly knowledgeable, articulate, hilarious and easy on the eyes. Love the hair! He'll have no problem getting his PHD.", "Awesome prof.

She is not helpful at all, is you ask questions, she looks at you as if you were an idiot. Her opinion is the only opinion that matters! Only take her class is you need it to graduate!!!", "Dr. Ostovich is an amazing professor. She is highly knowledgable and is completely willing to help anyone who asks. You do need to work hard though, she does expect you to bring your best to class!", "Dr. Ostovich is a great prof!!  Her lectures may be a bit dry but they are clear and informative.  You have to work or you will do crappy.  She is very willing to spend time helping ANYONE who asks.", "Loves Shakespeare, but not people in general. She summarizes his plays which is unecessary...we all know how to read and comprehend. She never gave an in depth reading or critical viewpoint of Shakespearean plays. She is also just not a nice and approachable prof. Avoid her at all costs!!", "After reading these comments I had second thoughts about taking her class.  But If I had dropped her course based on these comments it would've been a huge mistake.  Dr. Ostovich is incredibly insightful and asks very interesting questions that make you think.  She gives alot of work, but a challenge is a good thing.", "Not approachable if you are struggling.", "Dr. Ostovich is a very nice lady, but I found some of her teachings of the plays lacked depth-lots of synopses, etc. The film clips shown in class were great, but the fickle-marking TAs were not.", "One of my favourite English profs ever. learned so much from her.  Be prepared to work hard!", "No Comments", "No Comments", "She is very knowledgable in her field, but in no way does she encourage student discussion.  In a graduate class with three students and mandatory attendance, (with three two hour presentations) it is unreasonable to award a B- for participation. She considers her opinions to be absolute fact; she is entirely unwilling to entertain any other ideas.", "I used to love Shakespeare, her class ruined it. Sure she knows her stuff and all, but the presentation was boring and she made us act in an English class, then told us it was horrible and essentially useless. Worst english class ever.", "Don't take her classes if you aren't prepared to work hard.  Unlike many people have said about her she isn't a wicked witch...she really knows/loves drama and gets pissed off when people aren't reading the plays.  If you listen to what she has to say, and do the work you will learn a lot from her.  She is very respected in the drama community.", "She is the wicked witch, (Ostowitch)of the Englilish department, and possibly all of McMaster! She chooses favorites, is ALWAYS right and never shuts her trap about her stupid plays and projects! Watch out if you're not on her goodside, she is a nightmare!", "She's is horrific, screwing up her face and giving dirty looks to students as they present in their 4th year seminars&#63;&#63;&#63;!!! It's supposed to be a place where we can talk about ideas and not feel uncomfortable. It's all about her and her plays and projects! Her English class is like a theatre class, and not a good one.It's Ostawitch for a reason!", "You people who are hatin' on Ostovich need a wake up call. THIS IS UNIVERSITY. Not highschool! Grow up and do your work. Babies. No one is gonna spoon feed you an education. Too often people want to know what high learning can do for them How about trying to figure out what you can do WITH IT! Suck it up or give it up", "No one has &quot;grudges&quot;. She's a very confusing prof. Her explainations are confusing and she is unable to express her ideas clearly to the class. Her ENGLISH classes are too film based and her topics all revolve around staging and theatres. She likes to pic favourites and is not helpful at all.", "Ughhh...all i'm saying is, it's a good thing Shakespeare is dead....", "an interesting and exciting professor - she brings new interpretations to canonical elements of english. i really enjoyed her class - the previous two posters have grudges. she's smart and cool!", "incompetent, unhelpful, irritating...a waste and time as a prof.", "Ostovich is judgemental, and extremly unhelpful.  This Professor is not out to help her students, she is out for herself only.Also, don't try and write too well for her, or you will be accused of plagarism and given an F.She is the worst example of higher learning one will ever encounter.", "An excellent prof, if given a chance. Has a bad reputation, but if you try to work with her you will see she is a brilliant and helpful prof. Don't judge her by the comments here, she really is a great prof.", "Terrible class. Lectures consist mainly of plot summary. Proof of her craptacularness (yeah, I'm an English major)&#63; The majority of the class escapes at the break. Furthermore - - Dr. O seems to emphasize performance over the texts. I don't feel she's taught me anything substantial.", "OK, so yes, Dr. O's reception is bad, and I agree with most ppls comments.  She is untolerable of any sort of absence, even when essential or unavoidable. Unforgiving, stubborn, and misleading.  She lets you think that she agrees with your ideas, and then s***s all over your mark! Awful!", "The worst professor at Mac. Now I know why this was one of the required courses needed to major in English... because if it wasn't, no one would take it. Ever. She's a horrible, horrible woman.", "All I can say is that this woman has made my year completely miserable.  I do all of the readings, and I always hand my stuff in on time...show up to all of the lectures, and understand fairly well-yet I am pulling of c's and c+ on everything. I am also disapointed about the lectures.Don't take her!", "Good Prof. I suspect the people who are ****ing about her just didnt do well in her class. Smart, funny and a lot of fun. Open to new ideas.", "I consider myself a fairly strong writer, yet end up with 60's on every 'short' paper--plus the comments are not helpful.  She seems to know a lot about drama but, has a hard teaching it.  All she ever lectures on is a sumary of the play-and those who read them before lecture are left frusterated!", "totally, completely unorganized!!!", "If you take this course be prepared to hate your life for an entire school year -- and hate her for life", "Oh c'mon!  Dr. Ostovich is, first, a leader in her field and it shows (edits Jonson for The Oxford).  She's also a great communicator if you make it clear what needs knowing.", "A terrible person and even worse prof. Made me hate the class and the entire English department. She's a very hard marker that tends to discourage creativity and free thinking. Way too focussed on performance. I don't think I learned a single thing.", "Go to hell and", "If you don't agree with her, and your short papers don't reflect what she thinks is right, you will get crap grades. Go to Lectures and listen to what she thinks to be right and then repeat information on exam, and you should get a decent grade.", "This woman is a horrible person.  She is unorganized and inconsistent in her grading.  Only cares about a select few and all others should drop her course because you will not achieve a satisfactory grade.  Don't learn the hard way - DROP HER COURSE!", "Cruel lady, unfriendly, unhelpful.  Don't expect to get very far in her class unless by some miracle she actually likes you (how unprofessional).  It's too bad someone with authority at McMaster can't realize how awful she is.", "Has favourite students and grades them that way.  Her favourite number is 68 so be prepared to get 68% on most of your essays.", "No Comments", "great class! she's interesting and has good ideas.  she does read from her notes tho...", "Difficult, but fair. Only minus is that she treated dumb students as such.", "All over the place.

I dont recommend her at all. Her lectures are pretty good, but her exams are very very hard, esp the midterms.", "I agree. Water under the bridge.", "Interesting Material.", "Dude, Social Psychology was 4 years ago. You got a bad mark. Get over it. Move on.", "She was really tough. The course sounds so easy. &quot;Social Psychology&quot;. Her exams were B.R.U.T.A.L.", "SHE IS THE WORSTEST PROFESSOR IN THE WHOLE WORLD. She thinks Social Psychology is a Science. She is FAR from reality. She lives on another planet if she thinks that nuisance called Social Psychology is a science!!!", "The worst psychology professor I have ever had. She was very unfair.", "I totally agree with some of the previous comments made for this prof. Her tests are extremely difficult. Worded tricky and she makes things harder then necessary. A psychology degree gets a student nowhere in life so she needs to realize that. My other friend graduated from Psych and she works at B Rail all day.", "She is the most unfair prof in Psych. If you study honestly you will get a poor grade most certainly if you are not a genius. If you cheat you will do well. She is a terrible prof overall who writes unreasonably hard tests for students. Psych is PURE garbage. A psych degree gets you a job at Macdonalds or Burger King for 8 dollars/hr, nothing more.", "Great class. Great Prof. Fun and funny and interesting.", "Awesome Prof. Very friendly. Great lecturer. Tests aren't easy, but straight forward. Study and you'll do well.", "As a lecturer, she is very good. She involves the class, and the lectures are pretty interesting. She gives examples in class that aren't in the textbook. Unfortunately, the exam didn't really reflect the main concepts. There were obscure references to the text (like a question on an intro section about aliens) rather than focusing on main ideas.", "Ridiculous. Too lazy to write her own tests, questions are clearly out of teacher's guide. Doesn't test understanding; rather tests memorizing. Insult to teachers everywhere. Advice: to be good at Psych 2C03, memorize every meaningless statistic and other arbitrary phrases in textbook. They will definitely be tested.", "She is a really good prof in terms of lecturing. Her slides are very not detailed, so you have to come to lecture to understand them. Her tests on the other hand are a different story- I found them way to detailed and hard, extremely based on the book. Class average was in the low 60's. Interesting course- but hard to get a good mark.", "Hard, extremely unfair tests, brutal beyond words, the textbok is a breeze, but the tests are something else--watch out for the 2nd midterm particularly. prof has no office hours, doesnt give her email addres on the course outline. it's social psych--a stupid dumb arts course, lame lame stuff, not a science course. She thinks psych is a science LOL", "Best Prof ever.", "You must attend class to pass the tests. Very misleading because the material seems easy but is not tested 'easy.' Very difficult to get a 10.", "oh maan she is SOO tough...her midterms are killer...it's such a lame course &quot;SOCIAL PSYCH&quot; ewwwww.....it's not a science type of course. Avoid this prof if you can. Her final exam is straighforward though, I'm gonna be honest here. Brutal tests, fair final exam.", "omg slowwwwww down plz!!! the rate at which she was speaking at was incompresensible and the review provided by the student t.a's was also very hard to comprehend..the prof is hard, and doesn't make the course easy...the midterm and final, i suggest u study, otherwise you'll fail she makes the questions very closely related so pay attention!", "Really great class. Really great prof. Take it if you get a chance!!", "Interesting material but not always presented in the most interesting fashion. Very helpful teacher with a genuine interest in helping you do well. Would recommend.", "hard class, but great teacher", "Thought the course was really interesting and enjoyed every class! She was very clear in lecture and gave many examples! I would recommend this class with Dr. Rutherford to anyone! Midterms were also fair and tested the material well.", "Awesome. Clear. Interesting. Great Demos.", "Not helpful and not very nice when you send her email. Never writes Hi, Bye, nothing. When I emailed her, I got the impression like she didn't want me to email her. Her lectures were quiet interesting so I must give her 5 for clarity.", "Fairly interesting course. Final exam is easier than the tests as long as you did the readings and went to all lectures. Prof never offered to help at all so it's hard to rate her on helpfulnes. The start of every lecture is like this &quot;Paul's office hours&quot; &quot;Elliott's office hours&quot; What about profs&#63;", "She gives you a cumulative final exam containing the whole damn book and it's only worth 32% of the final mark. She lacks basic logic. Why does she have to give the whole book on the exam if it's only worth equal to a test&#63; She never even posted solutions to the midterms.", "not a bad prof, but there was lots of reading to do. You have to remember an awful lot of information which is the whole book.", "She made me want to switch majors!  Great prof!", "She was hard, but clear.  Good lecturer.", "I found this prof to be quiet boring. This course is certainly not easy, even though it looks easy. Everything looks like common sense, but the tests and exams are quiet hard. I think Elliott Beaton (the guy who was TA last semester and prof this semester) can do a better job teaching it.", "She was by far one of the best profs I've had so far.  Her lectures were always interesting and her examples helped ALOT.  I think the people complaining are the people who didn't show up to class.  She favours the people who go to class.  Seriously, she was a great prof! Clear, fair, and funny too.", "Nice lady. Very good lecturer.", "1. Terrible experience 2. She gives boring and useless handouts everyday and gives you like couple of minutes to finish them 3. She never gave her e-mail add to the class (not listed on the course handout) and no office hours  4. Brutally hard tests/exams. This course is SUPPOSED TO BE VERY EASY!", "Here's how it goes: The first midterm was mediocre in level of difficulty (still towards the harder side) The second midterm was VERY hard and most people's marks dropped big time. Her exams are MUCH harder than the practice questions on the course textbook website. She lectures a bit fast as well.", "What are people on&#63;! Her midterms have been EASY so far.  Ambiguous&#63;  Just ask the T.A.s to clarify for you and they will!  She is a great prof! I don't read the text before class yet I still understand everything!", "Her tests are challenging.", "Her exams are incredibly difficult, with very few questions and they are worth so much. Most of the questions are worded very ambigously, the exam has very few straightforward questions. She doesn't even have office hours. Always tells you to go to the TA's Paul or Elliot if you need help.", "Some of the questions were worded in a tricky manner", "Hard mid-term...Focusses on very specific details from the text.", "The exams should be longer than just 40 multiple choice!", "Awesome Prof - supplementary info every class!  Tons of examples - attend lecture and you'll do great!!!", "Really, really fun class. Great lectures. Entertaining Prof.", "Hurray! Loved the class.

He's so knowledgeable and that definitely shows in class. He's a very tough grader.  My issue with Dr. Horn was that he was very unapproachable. I am a student with a disability and he seemed very annoyed to accommodate and was doing so bc Mac forces profs to. I didn't feel respected.", "Good storyteller, but you can't expect less from a prof who teaches the same thing every year. Does minimal work as a lecturer. Very unapproachable outside of class and doesn't provide lecture notes.

Each class was like he was telling a story. Very charismatic.", "Dr. Horn is extremely knowledgeable in history and is a good teacher, but this has made him very arrogant. He regularly insults the class without appearing to notice it. His lectures are good, but they are very fast paced so it is best to use a laptop to take notes in his class. He is also a hard marker and his handwriting is incomprehensible.", "Excellent lecturer, old-school style and doesn't try getting students involved (will answer questions, but leaves discussions for tutorial.) Take thorough notes, attend class, and you'll succeed.  Not an easy marks class, but marks are fair and supported.  Very approachable during office hours.", "Dr Horn is a great lecturer, and a very talented orator. He is very passionate about what he teaches, and imparts his knowledge and his perspective in his field while in lecture. He doesn't use avenue to learn, so lectures are mandatory.

A bit intimidating to talk to face to face, but great class overall!", "Friendly, organized, helpful, intelligent. Knows what hes talking about and lectures are extremely clear.

Never once did i look at the time to see when class was over!", "He totally knows what he's talking about.", "He knows what he's talking about and it comes through in his lectures.

He seems intimidating but 1 on 1 he's very nice and helpful. His TAs are ruthless, however.", "The man is jovial, and energetic. Unfortunately, that energy tends to result in him going off on tangents or spending 15 minutes on a concept that could be dealt with in 5.

He's a great lecturer, but he is not helpful and he has the worst TAs ever! Beware!", "Easily the most interesting history course i have taken at mac and it was all because of him.

TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HIM!", "Horn is the greatest gift known to man since Prometheus stole the flames from the gods of Mount Olympus for pathetic mortals. Perhaps, Martin Horn IS a god, gracing us with his divine presence. I do not know, yet I know this, his methos is legendary, the blitzkrieg of of intellectual force that will dawn upon you will likely cause intense histeria.", "Horn is hands down the best hitory prof I've ever had.

He is extremely arrogant and does not care at all about first years.", "Best history prof ever. Super nice. Great lecturer. I never skip a class.

He was like Bill Cosby. A very cool dude.", "His lectures do not correlate with the readings very well. His explanations can be vague. He's not very approachable. I don't know if he is a ard marker because I had a TA. Overall, i didn't think he cared too much about his first year lectures.", "The man is brilliant.  His style is perfect.  He knows everything.  Generally, the people who don't like him are simply complaining because of their marks.  He's one of the reasons I love my programme as much as I do :)", "Never appreciated him until now.  He has deadlines for his undergrads AND his grad student TAs to mark assignments.  We could always expect our assignments back in two weeks. Grad students weren't given preferential treatment just because they were grad students that had a lot of work to do.", "thank god someone else sees reality.  a very smug, self-satisfied instructor.", "a pompous boob.  if he's handsome, mike harris is a socialist.", "A good class and a good lecture. I too never missed a class.", "HORN IS THE FREAKING MAN. If you like his style check out Leeson and Swett. They are all amazing profs.", "Hot but hard.  Oh and for the record, I DID like history before 2S03 and I did attend every lecture. Don't put down people just because they don't share your views. Dr. Horn is a very demanding prof and I have no clue why so many people place him on a pedestal.  He's a fast and average lecturer.", "Anyone who says dr.horn is a bad prof obviously a)doesnt like history or b)doesnt go to class.  Albeit he gives people a lot of bad marks, but in many cases, they deserve it.  He believes strongly in writing and i think this will help many people later on.  Incredible lectures and very helpful!", "Horn is hot! whew, no one can deny that. He's also one of the most intelligent beings i've come across EVER. i didn't know one mind could hold so much knowledge. Amazing.", "Amazing lectures.

I would end up having wholesome conversations about life and university in general in her office hours. She really cares about her students and inspired me to go for a minor in Math.

TIP: do your assignments and old practice tests ! they truly help and if you abandon doing them altogether- then good luck..", "She seemed like a nice person, but I did not find her to be a great prof. She was good because she tried to make students do well. I did not like the weekly assignments because they were very hard to keep up with doing 3-4 each week, and I found the exam/assignment questions to be 9000x harder than lecture content", "Erin Clements is great. She really knows her stuff and can make even the most boring aspects of math fun, especially for scared first year students. Her grading is very fair and she will do everything she can to ensure you get a great mark. 1F03 is a lot easier than 1LS3, but having her as a prof for both made the transition very easy.", "Dr Clements is a very good professor.

Her lectures were never boring (even though its math), and she explains concepts very well.", "Did alot of examples in class , don't skip class !

Great Prof !", "Awesome teacher, very friendly and approachable.  If you ever don't understand or need to work an idea out in your head you can bounce ideas off her.  She likes talking with students, and she likes to help out when she can.  If you can take a course with her, probably worth it.", "She was fantastic. She works at a manageable pace in class and allows one to take great notes to refer back to when studying for tests. 2 midterms were easy, 1 was tough but doable, exam was a bit weird with a lot of application. Overall, she boosted my confidence in my ability to do well in math. Ended up with an A+ in the course.", "My advice to you is to attend the lectures and to pay attention during them. You literally will not pass the course if you do not.", "Only professor I've ever had that always knew the answer to every question asked by students.", "Great prof, always very clear and able to answer questions.

If you take the time to go to her office hours, you can see how much she genuinely cares for her students. She helped me get my mark higher by going over any concepts I did not understand.

Hated math in high school... love it now - might take more math courses in the future.", "Dr Clements is an excellent teacher! She *does* teach for understanding, she tells you exactly how to think about something rather than just memorize it. Now that I'm taking other math courses, I see how good her lectures were. Some things in math are techniques and rules, but still you need to understand what they are about.", "I personally don't like her as a professor. She's a really nice person. However, she does not know how to teach. She teaches is a style that is more memorization she never explains her math, and when she does she explains it more this is the way is it method. Piece of advice for future students, Im not the only one that felt this way. ", "She's energetic, and her smiles make class enjoyable. She's super kind and helpful with even the most simple of questions (which sometimes got annoying, since she would make SURE the person who asked understood before moving on). The exam was worth either 40 or 90%, whatever gave you a higher mark. She's also hilarious with tech (pen, anyone?).", "other than my self esteem because she's so frigggin hot this prof helped me solo much in this course her lectures were very clear and she's such sweetheart. VERY clear about what will be on tests and VERY understanding ", "Math 1F03 is a class for those who have not completed grade 12 calculus. I am NOT a math person, but Clements made me enjoy AND do well in math. She's sweet, funny, and always willing to clarify concepts. Her lecture slides are fill-in-the-blank style and crystal clear.

Super kind and understanding and all her notes are extremely clear...even if you aren't a math person, you can do well", "She was the sweetest! Definitely was a surprise walking into my first lecture and seeing such a young professor teaching math. And don't let her age fool you, because she definitely knows the material. She's so kind and answered questions well. Although sometimes she did move very quickly, if you asked, she would slow down the pace. Wonderful prof!", "Her class was my absolute favorite last semester. She was very nice and often had a joke or two. While being cheerful and nice, she's also determined to see you do well and does an excellent job at teaching concepts, clarifying misconceptions, and is extremely relatable on a youthful level. She's young and loves her job, love her passion for math!", "best prof i had in 1st year, every math prof should be like her", "I absolutely love Erin- she's such an amazing teacher and really cares about her students. Her lectures are great and she does lots of examples. She's also very honest about what is important to study for tests, so that was very helpful!", "She was awesome! Very clear, very good prof.

It also doesn't hurt that she's easily the hottest prof at Mac.", "Erin is an absolutely amazing instructor. She doesn't even compare to others I've had. I went to every lecture and found them very helpful. Also reading the textbook helps a lot. She is SO helpful and understanding.. out of this world!", "Great prof. She's so young, it seems only fitting to call her Erin. She's very good at explaining topics and engaging the class, yet she has no control. She never told people to keep it down until one girl exploded during class about the noise. Otherwise she'll just thank you for shushing people. Long midterms and easy exam. 90% exam was my saviour", "Nice, midterms were too long, but the exam was easy.", "Understanding, caring, smart, reaches out to students, agree with last comment: unreal.", "Unreal", "She is SOOOO great! I love her teaching style and she can make everything clear and easy than any other profs! very friendly!!", "Awesome prof! Love her teaching so much. She is not all full of herself expecting students to know everything. VERRRRY helpful and very friendly. It's like she is too good to be true (for university). LOL. I love Math so I loved the course.

I didn't", "Great teacher who really knows her stuff and does her best to keep to explain concepts in ways that the students can understand.", "I am in love with this girl, honestly she is the perfect woman! I'm going to be devastated when the term is over! Goodbye my looooooooooooove!!!!", "excellent instructor, knows her stuff", "Very detailed in topics.  will answer and explain even the easiest question during lecture if you get lost.  Has a high school feel which is great transitioning to university classes.  Very nice too.  Doesn't teach over your head.  lots of examples.", "Dont know why everyone finds her easy i found her tests kind of hard. If you do the sample test and get everything, that means nothing also not alot of time to do her tests. I only did 2 tests so far so have to see how it goes. Also she isn't that clear but still better then a few other teachers.", "Her presence made 8:30s worthwhile.", "Overall quite clear in her teaching and made class enjoyable. Tests pretty easy. I just wish she would go a bit faster, one time Lovric substituted for her and it was clear to me he was a much better lecturer overall. However she is young and new so it's not her fault", "very helpful and direct with her teaching. explains concepts well and clearly. also very pretty ;)", "Clements was an overall good teacher. Sometimes she would go a little too slow, make a few errors, and you could tell she was new to using the smart board. The tests were easy if you studied for them, the exam was okay. You didn't really need to go to class since the notes had everything except solutions to problems.", "You are very lucky if you had her as a prof. I hope that she teaches upper year math courses and that would be heaven - just being in her class is already heaven", "She's adorable when she gets embarrassed because the technology isn't working. :) Her history as a high school teacher shows in her straightforwardness and desire to have students understand what's going on.

Go to office hours, ask questions, make learning fun.", "Super unclear and confusing. Just learn it yourself from the textbook.", "Great prof. The lectures were very good and clear. The tests were easy and fair. Just study and you are guaranteed a really good grade with this prof.", "TERRIBLE handwriting. Can't read it at all. Very confusing to listen to. Tests were difficult as the marking scheme used led to silly mark deductions. Overall OK prof. Going to class isn't mandatory as she simply regurgitates the textbook on the board.", "Very nice and caring person. Always wants the best for her students. I went into the course with a negative mind and came out with a positive one. Do the practice problems and go to office hours, she is very helpful.", "She's been a very fair prof. Very organized with her lectures, fair midterms, if you pay attention and know what's important then you will do well. She's entertaining and very nice. I was worried about the class after reading her reviews but I think that for this class she was a dream!", "I *ALMOST* switched out of the Honours math program after I had this prof. I am a very good student but due to Dr. Bronsard's RIDICULOUS marking style, I earned a C+ in this course even though my mathematics and statistics grades in all other courses range from B+ to A+. I was horribly disappointed. She is not a very fair prof, I am sorry to say.", "She was my PHD supervisor years ago and since then I have despised math. Her explanations were poor, she was never available when I had questions and she constantly insulted me. I can understand why so many students have problems and discouraging comments about her.

She lacks compassion and does not think what shock and trauma the student will get when they see her marking", "Worst prof on campus. She expects students to answer according to what she thinks is correct. However, as a professor she has it so easy because all she does is read off a piece of paper and copy notes onto a blackboard. Clearly she doesn't know math, yet she grades so harshly on students. What a hypocrite.", "Worst Professor I have ever had. I guess when she marks she does not take into account the feelings and consideration of the student's hard work.

She will basically nail your paper with no mercy and when you request more marks she will not give it to you.", "I failed this course because of this prof. She loves to see students do poorly.

Most of the marks on her tests come from graphing the phase portrait correctly. The numerical calculation has very little marks attached. I dont recommend this course to anybody!!!!", "her teachings are fine but she's a really really mean marker... if you make a small error, she'll give you 3/10.

If you want to study a Thomas Hardy novel for NINE WEEKS, take this course (when he was teaching it). And he cancels classes all the time.  Thank god he is gone from MAC.  Worst porf in the history of teaching; he's an idiot", "Great Prof. Enjoys teaching and is always considerate of students needs in terms of deadlines, extensions, etc. Makes class as interesting as possible.", "Tim taught me a few times.  He was the only prof who required us to put our theories into PRACTICE - something I feel that is very important. Interesting, relevant material too.  He also went out of his way to help me with my master's applications.  An all around good prof.", "So wonderful and teachy.", "BLAH BLAH BLAH, is all i learned from this course. Serioulsy get over yourself, i mean you're hot but there's no need to be an egocentric maniac!", "Tim Walters makes us laugh... thereby distracting us from the fact that he has taught us nothing.", "He's one of those 'cool'professors you know, like you see in the movies.", "A good prof is passionate about the material, a great prof is passionate about empowering the students.  Tim Walters is passionate about both of these things.  He is the only person at McMaster that made me feel like I was more than a number.  Best prof and teacher I have ever had.", "Best Prof EVER!", "Interesting, Engaging, and he cares about the student", "No Comments", "He's compelling, and interesting...what's not to like...for those whiners...it's a 3rd yr course.  BUCK UP.", "I'd give Walter's a perfect score if I took courses to be entertained. However, I don't. I take them to learn. And the thing is, while Walter's is pretty entertaining, I don't learn jack. And his multiple choice are just flat out stupid.", "Awesome prof. Tends to be a little wordy, so go to his class expecting to listen and take notes.  Don't be bitter if you took his course as a bird course and found out otherwise. Great examples, and very insightful. One of the only profs I've had who takes suggestions from his class about how to make it better.  And last but not least, EYE CANDY!!", "Super smart and accessible...and hot.", "Modern Countercultures sucks. It is Nov. 22 and he still hasn't lectured. I have learned nothing. On the plus side, he marks super easy. Whatever.", "He's an excellent prof.  This course was educational, fun, thought provoking, and philosophical.  Really made me reflect upon society and my stance within it.  He is very educated and passionate about what he's teaching, and presents class material in a fun way.  You will not be disappointed...", "Too many of you talk about Tim as though he's an entertainer instead of someone who's teaching us to think hard. Understanding pop. culture is NOT easy or simple. Far from it. Smarten up, do the reading (even if it's 'no fun,' poor babies) and come to class ready to think. I am, and this is a really stimulating class that I'm learning lots from.", "HE SUCKS SO MUCH. NEVER TAKE THIS COURSE. WALTERS... MORE LIKE FAULTERS.", "Tim is a good prof overall, he likes to throw in some jokes to liven things up. I think he does a good job at being approachable, he is not intimidating at all. Unlike many profs at Mac. Anyway, overall thumbs up!", "Walters seems to have no real direction. and talks only about what he intends to talk about in the future.", "tough teacher very unclear lectures because he reads from a paper...no excitement and his book choices arent very good and fun to read...i wouldnt take this course unless necessary", "Tim Walters lacks expression when he speaks.  His monotone voice bores me and he does nothing in his class to counteract his lack of excitement.  Dr. Hunter's ENG 1B03 class was far more visually and intelectually stimulating.  Though the material in Tim's class was worthy of studying, Tim made the class a bore.", "Plays down to his audience; this isn't a class for the heavyweights of cultural theory, it's more a survey of what's going on. Great for introductions to the basics of consumerism, rebellion, etc., but... he just seems to want to be too cool. And it's really irritating.", "Tim is approchable and helpful with material. He uses visual examples and movies that make the material understandable and easy to relate to.", "Dr Walters is the best!  I really enjoyed his lecture style.  Be careful though - soon you'll hate the establishment too.  Vive la revolution!", "Wow!  Tim is the most approachable prof ever.  He really wants you to enjoy his class, and the understand the subject matter.  Not to mention that he's dreamy!", "Although lectures were at times dry Tim's jokes made up for them. Always willing to help. Material was interesting and provoked thought.", "I found Tim fun and very smart.  His classes didn't give me much incentive to go, since there were so many presentations I could skip it without consequence, but I REALLY didn't mind.  He brought cookies to the exam dude...you can't go wrong with a guy that awesome.  And 6'6&quot;&#63;  Oh my yes.", "Pop Culture and Modernity/Postmodernity.

For this, 2J03 one of the best classes I've ever taken", "Anyone who says stuff like &quot;waste of my money&quot; about a prof like Tim is a bellend. Walters is by far the best prof at MAC, and actually makes you interested in whats going on. Doorknobs like you people are what makes MAC humanities the joke that it is.", "Definitely makes an effort to break down the barrier between student and prof. Assignments involve practical application, which helps learning immensely. Best exam I've ever taken too. The only class I've taken where I've made an effort to be at every lecture. Unthinking consumers beware...", "What a joke. This professor is more concerned about getting his students to like him so he'll get re-hired than he is about teaching the material thoroughly and comprehensively. Teaches two classes exactly the same, gives the most ridiculous exam I've ever experienced. Waste of my time and money.", "i hate this class.", "Great prof. Best evaluation methods ever.", "horrible. better at acting than teaching.", "Boring... and doesn't explain the readings well at all.  I understand his lectures but he rarely relates it back to the text which makes it very difficult to understand parts of the course. I feel like he takes more time to crack jokes than actually teach the course well.", "he rambles far too much and spends far too much time to trying to be entertaining. i learned more from my TA.his assignments were a joke and website participation is a joke. AND he uses the SAME readings for different classes, how about actually creating two different courses&#63; horrible prof.", "Really cool guy, funny, interesting when asked questions, pushes you to think independently, he should be a bit more explanatory of his material, and be a little bit more theory orientated, but I had the BEST CLASS at mac with this prof so far.  Keep it up dude!", "Tim is one of the best Profs around. I love going to his class, and he's friggin hilarious.", "Awesome guy.", "A good class with a good looking Prof! :P (I'm so bad--but there are so few good looking profs out there!!!)", "A relaxed teacher, never makes students feel dumb for asking questions. Fairly marks and very fair with assignments.

Brilliant lady, lectures a little boring at times, test and exam were fair, assignments crazy hard - only doable when working in groups. Overall she really pushed for working with others and getting help. Do that and you're fine", "I really enjoyed Professor Haskell as a teacher. I think especially for 2R03, you need to use your resources effectively to do well, and you need to study hard. She is extrememely helpful and knowledgable and I think people should see this side in her. It's easy to blame a challenging course on the prof. It's most likely the students fault", "I was in her 1b03 class in my first year, she did great and the projects were interesting.

I found her flexible and accomodating and she was never ever rude or sarcastic or arrogant. She is more fair than most other profs teaching math 2R03", "Assignments were, in general, terrible. She asked us about things we'd never heard about in our lives, and expected us to use them. Tests were straightforward, fairly graded. I found it hard to learn from Dr. Haskell, just because it doesn't seem like her heart is in the material.

She doesn't concentrate on the important stuff which is what comes up on her tests", "Terrible. Just terrible", "she's by far the worst prof I've had in all my life. she's selfish and self-centered. and inconsiderate. and she acts like she cares bout u when she really is worried about herself. she teaches horrible. she puts things on the test/assignments that she never really talked about. overall: WORST prof ever.", "very good instructor!", "Worst prof ever had!", "i was in her 1b03 class in my first year.. she is definitely a decent teacher, excellent prof... go to her lectures, study her notes, you will easily get a A", "She is really nice", "Good prof, but nothing truly enthralling with her. A lot of time is spent on proofs but thats ok.  Sometimes sleep can come over you very quickly in her class.", "Most people complain that she does too many proofs...I think there's no such thing. What good is learning math if you have no idea where in the heck it comes from&#63; Who cares if you don't need to reproduce it on the test...that doesn't mean you can't be shown the logic behind it. I think that is more a problem with students than it is with the prof.", "spent a lot of time on proofs", "Fell asleep everyday. She spends too much time on whats not important. She needs to answer questions better and give more examples.", "Had her in the morning and fell asleep each and every class. She is nice and approachable, but spend too much time on proofs and theory and not enough on actual examples. I stopped going to her lectures and went to Taylor's class. He did examples for the duration of the whole class and on the board, not on an overhead. Lovric is great too!", "Helpful and nice prof.  She definitely spends too much time on proofs that we don't have to know for tests to the detriment of teaching us things we actually do have to know...but she tries.  If you have a question, she's more than willing to help you out, which is great.", "What a terrible teacher. Not to be rude or anything, but spending 3 days on pointless proofs (when we are in calculus) is very tedious, especially when we later learn that they are not on the test!!! I fall asleep for class, wake up, and all we have done is de^x/dx is just de^x.  If i was bad at calculus, id be failing.", "I had her for Math 3E03 and Hans Boden for Math 3EE3.

Lin Alg is a confusing course, so it's not totally her fault.  Didn't understand all the material until night before exam.", "A very good math prof, and my only first year class that I (found worthwhile and) attended.", "I did well, 'cuz I'm kind of a math geek...so maybe that's why I thought she was a decent prof.

Her real world experience is top notch (she runs a consulting firm while she teaches) and is an expert on anything you could ask her. Always comes to class with amazing energy and you will not see people skip her class. She feeds you an A if you follow her instructions and the most fair exams you could ask for", "I literally have no idea in the world why Dr. Teal Mcateer is not the number 1 rated prof on this page.  I have been at mac for 3 years and teal is handsdow the greatest prof at the mcmaster entirely. If you take her class, you'll see the lectures will never be missing ppl and not because of participation marks, but because her lectures are amazing", "awesome prof, loved all her lectures, she doesn't care much about testing more about teaching", "talks fast but best 1BA3 prof and cares about her students", "Awesome", "My favourite professor at McMaster. She is incredibly caring and is an amazing teacher! Great class :)", "Amazing lecturer. Insightful, caring and passionate.", "Very passionate prof. She cares about her students and wants them to succeed. BUT, she talks way to fast, focuses on unimportant things and can be super confusing in lectures. It doesn't help that the material is extremely boring.", "Teal is a very funny. caring and concise person. Her lectures are informative and if you attend them you will not have to read the textbook unlike many other courses. The highlight of Teal is her industry and personal experience which bring real-life examples to the classroom.", "Fave class by far. She really cares about her students and makes her lectures as interesting as she can. Uses real-life examples to help students understand course material. Be aware that you do need to read the textbook for midterms and exams but she does great reviews and gives a lot of hints! The only 8:30 class I haven't skipped.", "She's awesome.", "Great Prof, she always grabs your attention and is easy to follow along with. Her test reviews are thorough and she prepares you well.", "She loves her job and students and she'll tell you that! She has good stories that she uses to relate to the concepts and theories learnt in class. There were 3 group projects, and they were very simple if you read the textbook! READ WHAT SHE SPECIFICALLY TELLS YOU TO! The exam was NOT cumulative which was blessed. Hands down my fav prof!", "her course is actually really interesting and i would definitely recommend taking courses with her. i would take another course in HR with her again.", "Dr. McAteer really cares about her students.  Her lectures are very detailed and engaging.  Dr. McAteer wants you to get a great mark in her courses; however, that does not mean that her courses is easy.

She has a way of engaging the entire class, and making the information a lot easier to understand. I really hope I can take a course with her sometime in the future!", "My favourite professor who is enthusiastic and passionate about the course she is teaching now, and totally love her students! Go to her office hour and talk with her! You can learn a lot from her lectures which is beneficial for your future even if human resource is not your intersr . I hope I can still choose her class in my upper years! :)", "Teal is simply the best professor at McMaster University, I have only been in her class for a short amount of time, and I already feel the need to come a review her. She is also one of the nicest people you will meet, she genuinely cares about you as a student, but doesn't treat you like a student, she will treat you like an equal and respectfully.", "She was an amazingly inspirational prof. who's main goal was to help us do well in the course and learn things that we could use in our daily lives.", "Amazing professor. Really knows her stuff. ", "So far in my 3 years at McMaster, I have yet to have a prof that tops Teal. She is so fantastic and passionate, it's infectious. Even if HR isn't what you're into, she makes it interesting and makes you see the value in it. Go to lecture, take good notes, put in the effort, and you'll do well in this class.", "Each lecture is just an act, and she's horrible to listen to.", "Teal is one of the most creative profs. She challenges you by her in depth lectures that exclude filler material. She shows you the ropes for real life. She speaks to you not at you. Her hilarious one-liners make you understand what she's talking about when giving real life examples. You are given all the tools needed for an A. (Very stylish too)", "Really cares about her students.  Wants everyone to do well and succeed.  Is extremely enthusiastic about all the course content which makes the lectures very captivating.  The tests and assignments are fair.  If you listen and take notes in class it will be very clear what content you should focus on for the tests and assignments.", "Great professor! She offers her students to mark your resume, and provides awesome feedback. Passionate, wants to see students succeed. For the in class assignments, divide your group into questions - but be sure to review all questions, it helps with the time crunch if someone can't finishgets stuck. Very fair assignments! Great class,learn lots!", "Extremely knowledgable and passionate professor. She is excellent at conveying the course material to the class as well as providing examples and class activities to help solidify the knowledge.  Her tests and assignments are very fair and all her questions are extremely applicable to the topics discussed in lecture and in the textbook. ", "All round, a great professor!

Content is interesting, if you follow along in lecture, and review concepts in the textbook you are unclear for, you will do well! Good luck!", "Talks all class without putting most of the relevant information (ie. definitions) on lecture slides. Its extremely hard to keep up in lecture. Never really sure what content is relevant or not. She has made it a point to indirectly say that every lecture slide will be on the exam.", "poor teaching skills with speedy lectures making it  impossible for students to take all notes down. Her lecture is more likely a typing contest instead of learning something useful. please slow down your talking!!", "Great professor all around. Cares about her students, is adaptable to the class at hand, and a very good communicator. Favourite prof at the school.", "great prof, hard tests but very doable if you study she really wants you to succeed", "Such an amazing professor. I've never met a professor so obsessed with helping students to success. She's a blessing to the Commerce Department at Mac. In Class Assignments/Group Work is straightforward. Her midterm is tough, so study hard.", "By far the best prof I've had at Mac. She is one of the few professors who actually follows through with helping the students whether it's putting a star beside important info, reading through countless resumes or telling us exactly what to study for an upcoming assignment. The profs at Mac i've had have been pretty bad, Teal is an exception.", "Taking Teal's class has completely transformed me in a way that no other class I have ever taken has been able to. She is genuinely interested in helping her students succeed and is willing to go out of her way to do so. The best business professor at Mac!", "Great prof ! Very engaging and made a rather boring class interesting. Thoroughly explain concepts. She has her own consulting business and offers to edit her students resumes for free.

She loves being a prof and is great at it! Love you Dr. T", "Great professor. Very knowledgeable from real world. Gives relevant examples. Makes class fun. One of the best teachers I've ever had!", "What happened to Teal&#63; Its as if she has menopause/mid-life crisis. She used to be a better prof a year ago and now she is going down the tube.", "Best lecturer I've had so far at McMaster! She makes class pass by really fast and no one gets up to leave until she is totally done. She's that good. Textbook was useful for preparing for the in-class assignments. Sometimes she has weird handouts and jumps btwn material but I would definitely take a class with her if I had the chance.", "Amazing prof!! She's the most charismatic lecturer i've seen. Makes the course material seem like a piece of cake. Her assignments are fairly easy, given that you know your stuff. Gives great exam reviews before the mid term and final. As long as you attend class and listen to her, getting 80+ is easy! :) take both 2ba3 and 2bc3 with her!", "GREAT!!!", "All I got to say that she is an amazing prof!

Always tells us &quot;test results will be up by [this date]&quot; or &quot;new notes will be on webct by [this date]&quot; and they never are. Took 2 WEEKS for results of a scantron test and never updated us.", "Nice guy, funny. LOVE that he put all the lecture notes in a coursepack. Rest of the books are kind of pricey though. Lectures are very clear. Sounds EXACTLY like Robin Williams !!", "Absolutely amazing! Very helpful with any questions you might have. Knows way too much for a regular human being. Many believe him to be a spy. It would not surprise me at all.", "He's a pretty intelligent guy. If he made his lectures more coherent he would be an amazing professor.", "To all of those that were complaining that he missed alot of classes- That is because his Dad passed away- who lived in the states.", "Incredibly intelligent, the class was interesting, he's a great lecturer... when he has class. He was about 15 minutes late to every class, and cancelled at least 8 classes... he obviously loves the subject but doesn't seem to value the class.", "He goes on a lot of conferences so he is pretty much never there and when he does show up to class it is usually 20 mins late. Anthro 2G03 easy, 3G03 confusing and not a bird", "A good prof. Very smart. I went to his office and he talked trash about other profs... that made me uncomfortable. I had some of those other profs and thought that they are okay.", "Wow...don't know what to say about this course...however...take Anthrop 2G03 with him...easy as pie!", "Colorusso is the best prof EVER!!!  He's hilarious and his tangents make the course!  He's super intelligent (knows way too much) and helpful if you ask for help.  Recommend this class to everyone!!", "Colarusso is the man! His humour sells the class no matter how confusing the myth may be. Runs an excellent elective since he knows it's an elective (thus, easy tests if you study). Knows so much it blows my mind.", "Okay, everyoneted phonetics, and Dr. C. is pretty chaotic with his       approach.  But what a great prof.  For phonology he is already awesome, so knowledgeable and such a great sense of humour.  You can tell how passionate he is about learning.", "this class was so much fun,,,the myths are really entertaining to read,,,a good elective", "Dr. C is awesome. As someone mentioned, the dry humor is fantastic. And he knows what he's talking about, he always knows ridiculous amounts about everything. He rocks my little world.", "Dr. Colarusso is wickedly witty, in the driest possible way (I happen to like dry wit).  I really enjoy the linguistic snippets he includes with the mythology material.  It adds depth and context to the tales of the past.", "Awsome class and the prof is very knowledgable and at ease in lecturing.", "He's great at doing what he does; very enthusiastic about myth and very intelligent.  Everyone must take this class.", "He's very enthusiastic and knowledgeable.  And the subject manner is great.  He also knows how to make it clear and can make it very amusing.", "First off, his classes are not hard...however, 3G03 is definitely a great deal harder than 2G03.  He's always late for class, very Jekyll & Hyde with his behaviour (as someone mentioned, don't talk when he is).  Go for the class/content, not for the prof!", "Fantastic!  Did go off sometimes, but can't blame him, he knows so much!!  very interesting topic, take the class, especially if youre into myths..brilliant man (but don't talk while he's teaching......I warned you!!!!)", "go to 2g3 for laughs and fun, avoid 3g3 to save yourself a bunch of stress trying to figure out what he's talking about...knows way too much info.", "such an interesting prof...really good course", "Way too smart to be teaching the likes of us. An inspiring guy though. Especially when he talks about politics.", "More than fair with marks. Colarussian Tangents keep subject matter interesting.", "Loved him!Not for every1.Doesn't suffer fools.Brilliant, funny, goes on tangents", "Dr. Colarusso is very demanding and doesn't like students who ask questions.", "The man is a genius.

KNOW YOUR LECTURES IN DETAIL!!!", "His lectures are by far the easiest to sit through and remember. No lecture notes posted, same format for every course (midterm with 3 essay Q's), Essay for assignment, essay final exam. This class was a cooler version of Anthro 1A03 and more intimate. For the person who was upset that he told you shut up - who cares&#63; youre in university shut up.", "I found this professor arrogant and unreasonable.

Unpleasant experience, and have avoided him ever since.", "I felt like he was talking to himself a lot because he was very focused on his fond memories of his fieldwork and little else.  Seemed arrogant. I had hoped this first year course would have been a lot more than it ended up being, because he didn't delve into a lot, there were very few topics really.  But the lecture about AIDS in africa was good.", "Interesting lectures as he speaks about topics with conviction.However, alittle too much talk about his fieldwork.I really disliked when he told students to &quot;shut up&quot; during lectures!

If you ask for help or guidance, he makes you feel like you're being disrespectful if you say his directions aren't clear to you. Skip this class. Skip anything he teaches, unless you like professors that tell you to \"google it\" when you ask for help.  Never had a professor at ODU that's so disappointing.", "Didn't look at the text book. I enjoyed his lectures because he made them funny. Overall, I liked him, but not the class.", "While I don't agree with all of his ardently left-wing views, he made many good points. He gives the marks people deserve. His lectures are lively, but he is  distant and almost unapproachable in person. He seems to be a polarizing figure. I happened to like him. It's unfortunate that he has to leave this school.", "Awful prof. Horrible class. Dreaded going.Lecture is incredibly pointless, all you need is his ?list of words? and you?re good to go.  Class consisted of words that were not even relevant to the material, his life, the thrift store, and how none of us are individuals. Also, the text book was opened a few times to look at the glossary. Enough said.", "ENG 1BB3: Lectures are difficult to follow, little connections to the readings, and rants a lot. Very high expectations for first a year course, not easy to approach or talk with.", "Horrible professor. I did my readings and did not attend class and still managed a good mark though. All he did was talk about himself. His lectures were a waste of time", "Marc is horrible! All he talks about was himself and his cheap deals.. like his hugo coat he got at the Goodwill. During the CSCT class I had he went on and on about Walmart and the same topics everyday. I'm glad he's no longer at McMaster, him leaving made room for a meaningful professor.", "I took four of his classes and can't get enough, his anecdotes, images, and examples help you to apply critical thinking to everyday life. He is one of the few FAIR teacher at McMaster, acknowledging hard work and effort. It is best to get to know this professor you'll learn a lot from him.", "Approachable, Somewhat of a hard marker but will help you 100% if youre in need. Great guy.", "Anti-intellectual.  Seems more interested in confirming his existing half digested ideas and building a posse of mindless followers than doing real research. Thinks he's subversive for his bargain-bin wedding (which he'll show slides of in class).  This isn't subversive, it's shopping around.", "Honestly, I'd have to say that if students weren't 'getting anything' from his lectures, they were too put off by his manner to actually absorb anything. Personally, I think he's just trying to get students to mean what they say, and to stand behind it. Engage the material, participate in class, and do you work. It's that simple. (Or is it&#63;)", "... Marc*", "March is overwhelming! I could only get the best out of this class by dropping everything else and, since that wasn't an option, I had to drop the class. However, I still attended lecture - his lectures are THAT GOOD. The courseware was a tough read. If you aren't CSCT background, you'll cry (while simultaneously worshiping Ouellette).", "I've had this prof a total of 3 times.  Each time my experience with him got worse and worse.  He is the most conceited professor ever.  Attending his classes (which he makes attendance mandatory) was not only a waste of your time, but also your money.  All he does is talk about himself and rambles on about things that are completely unrelated", "Great prof, just stay ontop of your work!", "Talks too much about himself. The articles are not connected to the learnings of the course. Felt like I hardly learned a thing in this subjectively taught class", "Very intelligent man with great lectures and anecdotes. Every student is able to succeed if they're willing to do what's required of them, and yes, sometimes that means asking the professor for help. He rewards hard work with high marks and punishes laziness with low marks. Makes sense to me!", "I have taken 2 classes with Dr. Ouellette and I did find him intimidating the first time.  I had trouble with exam writing and as a result my final grade sucked.  The second time I took his class however, I worked up the courage to ask for help and found him genuinely interested in helping me to overcome my problems. Overall, great prof!", "I found him interesting to listen to, and he uses a lot of media clips etc. in his lectures. The guidelines for assignments are a little vague, but beyond that he seems to be quite entertaining.", "Completely pretentious, arrogant, and self-centred. Although he is an interesting prof that makes you want to attend class, you get little out of it. You'll find yourself learning more about his life then your course--and then end up screwed on assignments and exams. If you can put up with him, he's a cool guy--but a bad prof.", "completely pretentious. I constantly run into people who consider him one of the worst english profs. was obsessed with himself and was constantly talking about his own life. Its clear that he thinks he is a young, cool, hip prof when hes the complete opposite. He clearly likes what he does, but he is really whats wrong with eng profs.", "Love him or hate him, he was interesting to listen to. He could have been more clear in his essay guidelines as to what we're expected to write, however his essay writing methods changed how I write/view essays. I've taken to living out the lifestyle that this course represents and it has made me happier as a person. So despite u all, I liked him.", "Very interesting and, although some find this to be his downfall, uses various examples in his slides to make reference to the assigned readings and key words/concepts. Dare I say it&#63; Those who did poorly or thought he made no sense, were most likely not thinking critically enough.", "horrible prof. arrogrant, and self righteous. plays clear favourites in class. lecture slides need to be decoded before anyone can comprehend. goes on and on about how much better waterloo is over mac, how easily he forgets exactly whom is paying him thousands of dollars to teach. lies to students. i've nothing good to say about this prof.", "Passionate about what he's teaching but goes off on huge tangents about his own personal opinions (which he tries hard to get us to take at face value). He seems pretentious, and judgemental against those whom he considers &quot;trendy&quot;. P.S. tries too hard to seem laid-back, cool, and funny.", "Prof has clear favourites, no clear guideline of expectations. Textbook has no support for his lectures. His lectures have nothing to do with the terms he gives you, often goes on tangents and you wonder what you did in class that day. Course was somewhat interesting, not recommended as a 'bird' course.", "Great lecturer, Loved it. Assignments were very vague, &quot;if someone asks what i want on an essay, i tell them... I don't know&quot; his lecture notes don't relate to the text book ideally, his key concepts and terms are undefined. (could be clearer with that). Assuming ridiculously difficult examination, even if i did know how to write a test.", "cocky, rude, and arrogant.  very unapporachable and critical...i didn't learn anything for a whole semester.", "I can see what some might object to his teaching style, but frankly, why bother being in school if you can't stand to have your opinions questioned&#63;  Either way, can't be denied that he's one of the hardest working profs at mac, gives you more feedback on each assignment then some profs will give you all year. Not to mention briliant lectures", "Very arrogant and goes on a lot of tangents.", "A veritable broken record; once he taught us the same lecture twice. Nobody said anything because he is THAT unapproachable. Frankly, I can't decide if I'm offended by or OK with him talking about Otherness like he owns it. What do you know, you privileged white male (risking ad hominem)&#63;. But that one's a tricky. Enjoyed reading selection, though.", "Complain complain complain.  Completely pretentious, and has clear favourites.  Has no problem with singling out people who come in late to class.  Has a sick phobia of laptops, constantly thinking people are looking at eBay or Facebook rather than paying attention to his repetitive lectures.  So far left, that avid liberals would hate him.", "The only thing he truly taught us is that his way of doing things is the best and that &quot;everything sucks&quot;. The class had potential, but I couldnt stand his cockiness. And the exam was impossible to complete in 2h.", "Professor Ouellette made bad movies palitable, he is a prof that is not only good in his field but is a good teacher. Not many profs seem to be interested in teaching or passing on thier knowledge. Mark stands out, but be prepared to work for him, since he works so hard for you.", "He's very challenging and he does have clear favourites.  I found him interesting and engaging, but it seemed like we went off on tangents a lot.  The material was super and I enjoyed the class overall though.  The exam was brutal - most of us felt he didn't give us enough time to finish.  However, I loved the cultural issues we addressed.", "felt like the class had so much potential to be interesting,inspiring and informative...but i felt like we never acheived anything... lectures are constantly hearing people tell personal (and unrelated stories)and like someone else said, he has clear favourites and if you want good marks you'd better be one of them. readings & films were great.", "Marc is a great prof, perhaps one of the best! Unlike some CSCT profs @ Mac, Marc realizes that his students don't have a lot of prior knowledge in the field and breaks down theoretical issues into understandable terms. He makes you see both sides of the picture and is very helpful during office hours. It'll be sad to see him go.", "One of the most amazing profs Mac has to offer...really cares about what he is teaching and it shows.  His classes will change the way you look at the world.  Tough, but fair marker.  I admire his teaching style, which engages discussion and forces you to actually think. He lives his teachings,and after taking his class you will probably want to to", "No Comments", "Marc is a god among men. One of the greatest and most influential people I have ever met in my life. Thanks for opening my eyes.", "Probably the funniest and nicest prof ever. Makes me laugh", "You guys can say what you want about Marc but trust me you'll miss him when he's gone. You can't expect to get another CSCT prof like this in your lifetime. Not only does he know his**** but he actually lives it and I honestly can't say that about all the other CSCT profs here at Mac.", "&quot;In the serious play of questions and answers... the rights of each person are in some sense immanent in the discussion... The polemicist , on the other hand, proceeds encased in privileges that he possesses in advance and will never agree to question.&quot; - Michel Foucault. According to Foucault's definition, Dr. Ouellette is definitely a polemicist.", "I'm split between these comments. On one hand, Marc can be a very accepting professor. On the other, he can be very elitist and harps being a professor (which seems to go against the grain of the Cultural Studies field). He's fair though, and all in all, I do respect him.", "Marc's a very intelligent man,and he'll always listen to you point of veiw, regardless of whether or not is supports his own. He doesn't just take your words for they're worth, he likes to challenege his students to think about factors that they may not have otherwise. If you're not use to that,then it can come across as condescending.And He's hot!", "At first I enjoyed the lectures. However, after visiting Dr. Ouellette in his office the only way I can characterize him is elitist jerk. He makes people feel inadequate despite his all accepting appearance. He may know text book, but he needs to learn social skills.", "Excellent prof! Fair marker and by no means a closed-minded person. No one said you had to &quot;blindly&quot; believe everything a prof says but what he teaches makes sense and it's up to you whether to believe it our not. He answers your questions w/ questions to make you think for yourself, which is good!  AMAZING an very INTERESTING prof!  Excellent!!!!!", "Stubborn, closed-minded, extreme, condescending, aggresive, unfair...he is exactly what universities should do without. To the student that said that anyone who thinks he's not brilliant is a &quot;closed-minded hypocrite&quot;...at the university level anyone should know better than to believe (blindly) in every single thing the prof says.", "Brilliant brilliant brilliant...and not too hard on the eyes either ;)", "marc is an amazingly intelligent man and incredibly hot to boot.", "No Comments", "The only way you can find Marc not brilliant is if you are one of the closed minded hypocrites he is trying to open up. His willingness to help students is incredible and despite previous comments, he is not condescending, but he forces you to think for yourself instead of giving you all of the answers. He is exactly what universities need more of.", "I loved listening to his lectures b/c he's a very smart prof & has very interesting points to make. But the class overall made me feel stupid b/c I didn't understand a lot of the overall concepts. And his exam was the hardest exam I've ever written. He uses words & phrases that are waaaay too complicated. He needs to learn what simplicity means.", "A very enthusiastic, passionate guy. Yes, he's opinionated, but I really think he tries to respect everyone else's thoughts (and in a counter cultures class, we did have a lot of people who loved the Gap). He can get a bit off topic but lectures are always a good time and he'll stretch your mind.", "He seems like a fun guy in class, but is not very nice in one-on-one situations. The class was interesting, but it was hard to get past his know-it-all demeanor. Also,the exam questions were ridiculous. I'm not a fan...", "Hardest exam ever!! don't even bother studying...but that being said, he knows his stuff inside and out..has examples of EVERYTHING and presents the material in an appealing way but if you are looking for an easy course, this isn't for you, esp if he's the prof..2 essays & 1 exam seems easy but bewa", "He's a little intimidating at first, but his method of lecturing is absolutely perfect for cultural studies! He is engaging, entertaining, & life changing. Please, to be fair, you must put as much effort into the course as he does. Do not go into a class of his expecting an EZ ride! A brilliant man!", "His class was very intresting and I learned alot from the class. But, seems a little condesending to anyone who disagreed with him. Also, found it hard to understand some things that were explained in lecture. It would be good to read the textbook since most of the stuff he talks about is in there.", "Very random... dunno the point", "Very narrow minded/hypocritical. In a class that encourages free thought, he really doesn't value the thought of the students (b/c it's oppositional to what he believes). Assignments are ludacris, very unclear objectives. Also, a very convoluted lecturer. This class was a waste of time and money.", "Marc cares about his students and giving them their money's worth! He's passionate, incredibly intelligent and absolutely hilarious- which makes going to class fun. The course material is always interesting but challenging- be prepared to study hard when taking his classes!", "No Comments", "K enough with the &quot;in your grill&quot; comment Marc!Even if you paid me to be in his grill i wouldn't be there. His material is confusing and all he talks about his is own &quot;counter cultural&quot; life yet he is just like everyone else! He wants us to believe that he is superior but thats just not the case!!!", "1 on 1 Marc is great, But as a prof he makes students outside of his \u2018cliche\u2019 feel uncomfortable in class. A lot of the material is taken right out of the readings and very repetitive, as well the assignment outlines are vague. Course content had the potential to be good but I was disappointed!", "This prof cares. Knows his subject inside and out. Recommended readings and strategies that helped me thru a family crisis related to the course topic. Incredible!!!", "Funniest prof, incredibly accessible. Stays after calls til every question answered. Incredibly patient, even with the narrow-minded, homophobes, bigots and cellphones. Makes you think and won't hold your hand.", "If I had to take another one of his courses, I would seriously change schools. He is a biased, horrible, petty, small minded prof. I love cultural studies, and he almost ruined the entire discipline for me. If you don't agree with him, watch out, you will be penalized.", "No Comments", "One of the worst (probably the worst) teachers I have ever had.  &quot;Get up in my grill about it&quot; he'll say, then when you do, he cries like a baby.

Can pull examples out of anywhere!", "Hated...penalized my friend and I on marks because we did not participate...gave dirty looks when we entered the class.  I felt like I was unwelcome to even go to my class that I paid for! He also relied on student presentations and corrected the info.", "Wicked Prof!!  He knows his stuff, and considering the tough subject matter he teaches (gender and sex) he proves to be even more stellar!", "It was a great class.

He's funny, approachable and genuinely wants his students to succeed. Lectures were clear and the exams were very fair. Jasper's adorable as well!", "Absoloutly amazing prof! Very laid back, and makes jokes throughout lectures,which makes them entertaining. His passion for the material was inspiring, and the readings were covered very well in lectures. Easy to approach, and willing to help of jsut chat whenever needed. It was the only class I never missed! Take all his classes! I Loved Jasper :)", "Absoloutly amazing prof!

I Loved Jasper :)", "Great prof - laid back, hilarious, knowledgeable, very approachable. PowerPoint slides could be better but overall, Classics 1B03 - Intro to Myth & Lit with him was great. Loved Jasper!", "Awesome!", "He's amazing, I love his class the best and always enjoying going there to see what else he has to say!", "Professor McLean was fantastic, super dry, super funny, super knowledgeable. Doesn't hurt that he's young and hot. and his dog is adorable! I can't wait to take another class with him.", "Absolutely awesome prof", "He is a fantastic professor. Of all my classes I enjoy his the most. The way he teaches is awesome and crystal clear to me. I think those who were saying he was late or frustrated, well, yea he was late but he always got through most of what he had set out to do. Also,a frustrated guy cant exactly crack BOB jokes can he&#63;I personally found enjoyable", "Awesome", "absolutely entertaining and amazing!", "Just about the best prof around. Very entertaining, while at the same time making very clear what you need to know. Learned a lot, and had a great time at it.", "Dr. McLean is awesome and one of the funniest profs I've ever had. He brings his dog to class everyday, who is cooler than most people in the class. Yay Jasper. McLean stays up crazy late at night making wicked handouts and charts to help students. He genuinely wants everyone to do well in his classes, and he is one of the best Classics profs at Ma", "Amazing Prof.", "super funny and makes class worth going to", "he's awesome. he makes class so fun.", "He sucked.  Knows his stuff, but like he should.  He just can't teach it.  I've had better Greek instructors", "Professor was a very clear instructor. He went through the effort of creating information sheets explaining all myths and other information very clearly.", "Wonderful professor", "Dr. McLean is a fantastic prof. He made Greek fun to learn!", "I agree with the previous comment. He could arrive on class ON TIME. He is just angry and frustrated ALL THE TIME. Who could blame him, its Mac! Lectures can be funny but sometimes pointless. If he was more relaxed things would be better.", "Relies a little too much on the laptop. He could swear a little bit less and control his frustration a bit better. The last thing someone wants to hear on Monday morning at 9:30 is &quot;Goddammit!&quot; He could use a bit of work on arriving at class on time as well. Slightly unapproachable. From afar, in the lecture hall he's easy to listen to and funny =)", "Dr. McLean was very helpful with anything and everything. He is a valuable and needed member of the Classics department.  We are happy and lucky to have him.  He never had set office hours so whenever I wanted to speak with him he never said he was busy. If your reading this: Thank-you Dr. McLean for your patience and understanding, all year!!!", "He is one of my favourites.  Although sometimes he seems scatterbrained, he keeps lectures lively and entertaining.  He has an excellent sense of humour, and does great monologues (Can I mention &quot;the black bile of self-loathing&quot;&#63;).  It wasn't difficult to do well if you came to class and did the reading.  Great professor... and great paisley shirt.", "McLean was ok, Greek takes ALOT of your time, time is of the essence, and McLean didn't really make effective use of time, especially in the second half of the course.  I think he will get better with time, (at least I hope)", "AMAZING prof. Exams are based on lectures, and he makes clear what passages are important in the reading. You can do well just from lectures, but if you do the reading too what he has to say really throws light on it. The one thing to watch out for is that participation in tutorial counts a lot but he's really funny so easy to stay focused.", "Indeed Greek is really hard, If you were a kiss *** in this class and a keener you did well. You could put in all the effort you wanted and you still didn't get an A. Variety is the spice of life-thank god he isn't the only prof that can teach greek. THIS IS NOT AN ELECTIVE COURSE!!!!!!!!!", "Greek is really hard, but Prof McLean made it as fun and comprehensible as possible, and I wouldn't have stuck with it without him teaching it. He doesn't expect you to get it right, just to make an effort. not everybody could do that, and it looks like those are the ones posting the reviews.", "I had McLean for both first year Greek classes and lets just say...I'm glad it's over. He knows his stuff inside out, but seems annoyed when people don't get the material. He could have been better. I hope he gets better. He needs to get better! Some people are meant to research and some are meant to teach.... he should stick to the research.", "Dr. McLean was ok. I think he will get better with time, (I hope) Stay on top of things in the class, and hold him to things when he says he will do them otherwise he won't. (eg. WebCt posts) I'm still waiting for that 20% from the &quot;mid-term&quot; that we never had. A Laid back attitude, and it shows in his teaching style.", "McLean is ok if you &quot;get&quot; his humor. This half of the class sucked. Even tutorial The lessons went down hill and he left everything to the last minute.Including reviews,we didn't even have a second mid-term,the 20% was &quot;applied to our grades&quot;  Be prepared to do alot of nagging and pleading because if you are not on top of him things don't get done", "It's a good thing he knows his stuff inside out. He got better since last term because there were less ppl in the class.  You have to be on top of him, especially near the end of the course. He posted the answers for the review at 9:30 p.m on the nite b4 the exam and is never in his office,unless he absolutely needs to be.GOOD LUCK in this course!", "Dr. McLean is awesome, and hilarious! His comedy is enough reason to attend lectures, besides, his information is really interesting. Read all of the plays & go to class, but it's not too hard. His tests are fairly easy if you've done the above. Very approachable, responds to emails quickly. More than willing to help clarify & hear opinions.", "Dr. McLean is awesome, very good eye candy!", "At first Dr. McLean was intimidating. Once you got to know him and understand his personality it became easier to ask him questions. He does his best to help you understand the material, he never lost his patience considering our class.  In short, he was good!", "I thoroughly enjoyed this class. Although sometimes lectures seemed pointless, the course material was interesting and fun. Prof always answered emails timely and in great detail. Marks were fair and class was enjoyable. And who doesn't like a prof that gives a bonus question like that&#63;", "He created an uncomfortable atmosphere for students to ask questions and he made it clear that his time was more important. Condescending, arrogant and unapproachable.....what more is there to say&#63;", "Dr. McLean is fantastic so far.  He is very approachable and is always willing to help.  Funny too!"], "credit": ["N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A", "N/A",

I still use much of the intellectual capital and knowledge management frameworks and concepts he taught us back then.  His high quality instruction is more evident as the years go by.

Never picked on me in class for participation resulting in 0/25", "Nick conducted a 3 hour executive education seminar in Ottawa today that was simply outstanding.  Best session I have ever attended as a government employee.  Definitely worth your while to attend his courses.", "Took 5 Executive Education courses at Ron Joyce Centre.

Would highly recommend it.", "Dynamic teacher. Nice guy too. Uses Ivey cases.", "You will enjoy his 3 hour classes each week.

I was encouraged to seek his input from another student that he helped out last term.  Great guy.", "The reason why Dr. Bontis is an outstanding professor is because his strategy class is by far the most challenging yet everyone loves being there for the full 3 hours each week.  He forces you to work hard and by doing so you end up learning tons.  Although he's committed to teaching theoretical tools within the Diamond-E, he lives for application!", "PROS: Nick Bontis is a fantastic speaker, insightful case studies, great class discussions. CONS: assignments are demanding, participation is evaluated in every class, final exam is 5 hours long!", "an awesome instructor! tried making the class applicable to real strategic situations, multiple choice exam was difficult, case exam moderate, participation marks are graded by TA", "Bontis is extremely intense!!! You MUST be prepared for each class.  You MUST participate.  Guaranteed ... you will learn more in his class than any other.  His style is &quot;in your face&quot; but his delivery is outstanding.

Hes plastic and malleable- changes shapes to suit the audience. Not an honest bone in his body. FAKE, POMPOUS, FAKE and INSINCERE.

Intellectual light-weight holding absolute no ability in teaching a University level class.", "He was an absolutely amazing professor. He used rubrics for all of his assignments and was clear as to what he expected for each assignment, providing examples of poor and exceptional quality with explanations. There were no surprises and the exam was exactly as he defined it. I would take any course with him again.", "Biggest joke at McMaster. The man does not even know how to make a website, yet grades students on their skills. I consistently wonder where he found his degrees", "His marking is terrible. It is entirely opinion based, and he gives no criticism of value. He does not deserve to teach at any institution. His lectures are filled with watching YouTube videos that are not relevant to anything.", "Prof is straight forward about his expectations. On one assignment I got carried away and didn't pay much attention to his advice..I didn't end up with a great mark although I thought I did an excellent job. My point is - pay attention to his expectations. If you do, its an easy 80+ on assignments.", "Overall, Professor Hamilton was a very easy person to get along with, and was very helpful when i reached out for it", "Extremely opinionated, not willing to give help when you ask and doesn't seem to care about his students. He will act like a kind, understanding person in class, but if you go talk to him personally, he is cold, insensitive and uninterested in whatever you have to say. I hope I never have him as a prof again - 2 classes was more than enough.", "Dumbest class I've ever taken doesn't have any marking scheme and gives good marks to whatever he thinks looks nice.

Went to every class and still finished with only 75% of the tutorial mark without any explanation", "terrible", "Students get to caught up in his wittyness, and forget the fact that he is a poor instructor.

He is inconsistent with marking and his criticisms are highly invalid. When you look at the work he's done, any credibility for his artistic sensibilities you may have had go right out the window. That said, his classes are fairly easy.", "Terrible professor. Doesn't help you, is vague with instructions and has no patience whatsoever. He is also extremely opinionated and doesn't ever give you the mark you deserve.", "Somewhat lacking in confidence, and very inconsistent.  Uses no rubric of any kind.  Course book was a great coffeetable book, but we never used half of it, and it barely related to the assignments.  He knows a fair bit about animation, but is weaker at leading a class or relating to his students.  Failed to live up to my expectations.", "Wish he could make his lectures more interesting and go in depth on how to use certain software. Final test was easy. He tells you what will be on the test so it is important to show up to every class. &gt;Take notes!!", "I took both 2a03 and 2h03 with Hamilton. To start, I'll say that I did very well in both classes. Classes were for the most part interesting and fun, however, his criticism was problematic. It seemed to be based on personal taste and not at all academically grounded-NOT constructive and very unclear. I will avoid his classes in the future.", "He has no idea what he's talking about. He plays favourites and does really come down harder on people who know what they're doing. His taste levels are pretty questionable, and he doesn't use a rubric of any kind when marking. As the previous commenter said, arc the quality of your work to avoid getting crapped on at the end of the semester.", "This guy has absolutely no idea regarding what he is talking about nor what he wants. Often says one thing then contradicts himself.  In addition, he is very awkward and is unable to justify the BS that comes out of his mouth.

Aplia is basically free marks and is easy if you do the readings. If you do the readings and take your own THOROUGH notes/study your own notes you'll ace this class. Her powerpoints  and vids don't have everything, use just those and you'll be fine but not amazing", "She can be rude at times in class (i.e. do NOT walk through the front doors in MDCL after lecture begins or she will literally sneer at you).

She's very snarly though and not very approachable. God help you if your cell phone goes off in class. Her jokes are really lame but hilarious. Overall good teacher but kinda scary.", "She is middle of the road on helpfulness (not great).  She is very articulate and clear.
